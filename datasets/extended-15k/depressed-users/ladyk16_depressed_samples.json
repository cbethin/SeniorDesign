Anyway, I'm not... able to work now, I just can't, I feel that I'm not good at anything.

That's something that always interested me. I was very worried at first, because as a teenager I also had social anxiety disorder and school phobia. Luckily it seems that's not the problem for me anymore (or at least not so big). I'm like \"I'm too old for your shit idiots\". Small victory for me. Bad thing is that over two weeks ago I stopped going to that school. First I was sick, so I'm like \"OK. 2-3 days, I'll be better\"... Yep, I was better, but I started to \"stall for time\". \"One more day\", \"oh it so cold outside, I'm gonna be sick again!\" etc. So now I just can't go back to school, even that I WANT TO. But I can't. wtf?!\n\nI don't know if that's a sign of procrastination or still a depression. And it's not just about the school, but it is something that hurts me the most right know. I have similiar problem even with daily chores or stuff (like, idk... brushing my teeth... srsly?!)\n\nAnd about relaxing things - I have tv shows I WANT TO watch, games I WANT TO play, books I WANT TO read... at the same time, I don't want to do that things? And, for example, if I start playing game I feel guilty - that I wasting my time, that I should DO THINGS.\n\nI'm like I WANT TO DO STUFF. But I DON'T WANT TO DO STUFF at the same time.

Everything seems BORING, or pointless, or something else and everything at once. But SOMETIMES there's THE GAME. That one game that I can play for a few days or weeks, and I can really enjoy it. And I would like to found more games like this. I have a few criterias that could narrow options a little.\n\n\nTL;DR - I NEED GAMES THAT:\n\n- singleplayer that story isn't long - 30h max, OR multiplayer that main story isn't long but have some endgame activites (like Destiny 2)\n\n- doesn't require high reflex\n\n- less talking, more action\n\n- no survivals\n\n- no useless crafting and colecting tons of USELESS things\n\n\nSome games I've played (and like):\n\n- Destiny 2\n\n- The Division\n\n- Diablo 3\n\n- Football Manager 2016\n\n- Far Cry 3 - but I haven't finished it, got bored \n\n- MGS V - haven't finished, TOO LONG and kinda slow, like game mechanics\n\n- Borderlands 2 - finished it! (but co-op)\n\n- Crusader Kings II\n\n- Dishonored - FINISHED IT!\n\n- Mass Effect trilogy - finished, loved\n\n- ME Andromeda - a like it but... dunno, can't get into, too long and slow\n\n- DA:I - like it, but it was too long, I have no idea how I was able to finish it\n\n- Heavy Rain - just &lt;3\n\n- LA Noire - got bored after some time\n\n- also LOT OF Sims series and FIFA\n\n\nOk, that was a long rant.

And I really don't want crafting with this one. Potions I'm gonna buy, enchantments and smithing - I got a mod for NPC crafting these for (LOTS OF) money. \nMain skills I want it would be Illussion and Sneak. I just love casting fury/frenzy from shadows, it will never be bored for me. Speech for RP reasons. Same for pickpocket - since there is no way in game to persuade people to, for example, train you for free - I'm gonna pickpocket money from them, but in story way they just train me for free. \nAnd I'm thinking about other skills. Obv daggers and bows fit here best, but I want something diffrent. I can't deal with dragons and draugs (in the beggining) (and last guy who left after frenzy killing his group) with illussion and sneak. Staves seems to be interesting weapon, but i don't know if they viable (at least without mods). Conjuration is a option too, but I'm using it with my current game and I would like something diffrent. \nAnother thing: I don't know which race should I choose since he suppossed to be from rich and powerful family of warriors who rather don't like magic. Nord seems to be most logical, but I'm also thinking about Khajits (I've read somewhere there were Khajit warrior breed - Cathay-raht?)\nLast thing: quests. Since I'm gonna RP this guy, I won't do all quests. What drives my guy is power, so I want to do quests that give him that.
