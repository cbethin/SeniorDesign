Everybody makes it out to be a terrible experience and they wish they were a kid again  and this and that and everything about life just seems so god awful, and it\u2019s true! Everything is just terrible. I\u2019m tired of having hope that it\u2019ll get better because I\u2019m lying to myself. It\u2019s all lies- hope is the only reason I haven\u2019t killed myself yet. I want to get better but oh my god I know it won\u2019t. I want to be okay with my life and i want to love and all that, but I can\u2019t. Depression has destroyed everything and it\u2019s a hard thing to deal with. I\u2019m not going to die yet, but good god I really want to.

I\u2019ll give some context: I was having a mental breakdown yesterday and for months now I\u2019ve been asking her to take me to a physiatrist to have my medicine checked and to talk about what\u2019s going on (I actually do have issues, mind you.) I\u2019ll just type out the entire conversation so it makes more sense. I was actually screaming everything I said\nMom: I\u2019m trying my best but I don\u2019t know what you want me to do \nMe: I\u2019ve told you I need to go to a therapist. The doctor specifically told us that it\u2019s something I need in order to get better. Do you not understand that this isn\u2019t a problem that\u2019s going to go away? Do you not understand that I\u2019m actively suicidal? Do you not understand that I engage in self destructive activities? Do you not understand that the only reason I force myself to do so well in school is because I want to leave my current life without the option to come back? Everything I do is so I can leave this hell i call my life\nMom: I haven\u2019t taken you into the therapist because you have epilepsy \nMe: you\u2019re an absolute dumbass if you think my epilepsy is the reason I want to die.\nI then explained to her what epilepsy was and I said she\u2019s the reason I have social issues and that because she\u2019s done such a bad job about taking care of my mental health that I\u2019ve almost completely lost the ability to have empathy towards other human beings. I\u2019ve also given up all hope of ever getting better because of how long I\u2019ve been depressed. When she asked me to explain myself I said I wouldn\u2019t care if anybody in my family died. \nWhat I said wasn\u2019t a lie. Now here\u2019s the thing: I was diagnosed with depression when I was 6. I was also diagnosed with epilepsy (in case anybody doesn\u2019t know, epilepsy is seizures. It does not effect my depression) however, my mom genuinely isn\u2019t so smart. Like, I can\u2019t explain it she\u2019s a nice person but when it comes to intelligence, she\u2019s lacking (my dad is the one that supports the family. All she does is take us to the doctor. I actually do wonder if she\u2019s mentally ill)  I\u2019m not saying that to be mean to her.\nToday she was super nice to me and said she\u2019ll take me to the therapist. I know she\u2019s lying (she\u2019s said this before. I know what\u2019s going on in her head-she thinks it\u2019ll pass and I won\u2019t notice. It\u2019s happened countless times before). I feel bad because I know she doesn\u2019t get it and never will. I feel like I\u2019m expecting too much of her and that all I did was hurt her feelings without her even understanding what she did wrong. It\u2019s like hitting an animal: the animal doesn\u2019t understand what it did wrong, all it knows is that you\u2019re mad at it.

For example: I cannot do anything if I take a shower in the morning. The shower will be my entire day. I shower every day and I lost the whole month of October because of it. I also cannot remember anything since July. This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me. It also happened between the ages of 7-10 so I cannot remember anything from that time frame.

I\u2019ve been suicidal for 10 years but I guess I\u2019m just holding on because I have this outrageous belief that as soon as I\u2019m 18 I\u2019ll be magically cured of this horrid illness. It\u2019s not true but I\u2019ll continue to believe it. Anyways, that section was off topic. I just want somebody to help me because my life is a living hell and I cannot help myself.

It\u2019s not even their fault but yet all I feel is anger when I look at them. A few days ago I wanted to talk to my grandmother about it and before I even said anything I said \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you for how I feel, but I need to say this because I need to get help. I hated my childhood and I need to get over it but I can\u2019t without help\u201d and she flipped out and started complaining about her life. Like tf? Fuck her man. This isn\u2019t fair. Why can\u2019t/don\u2019t they understand? I feel like in order to get any help I\u2019ll need to start self harming in a physical way. This sucks and I cannot believe anybody has the nerve to say it\u2019s a teenager thing when I was diagnosed 10 years ago. It\u2019s not even that I\u2019m at an all time low. I\u2019ve definitely been way lower before but I\u2019m just so tired of waiting for my life to get better. This post was all over the place and it\u2019s extremely unorganized but I\u2019m not going to go back and reread everything I wrote.

It\u2019s weird. Anyways, I guess I\u2019m writing this because I\u2019m just tired of this. Feeling nothing most of the time, and getting nowhere in my life. I\u2019m 16, and I\u2019ve already succumbed to a life of misery. It\u2019s not going to get better. I\u2019ve been telling myself it is for years, and I\u2019ve been trying to overcome this damn mental illness but it\u2019s never worked. I really believed it would get better too but nope. There\u2019s something wrong with my brain and it\u2019s preventing me from moving forward. This dumbass illness is breaking me down and I can\u2019t do anything about it- at least not until I\u2019m 18. My whole life has been waiting to reach that age and for what? So I can begin my life? I hated my childhood, and I hate being a teenager. I really mean it when I say it will get better to other people, because it does. They don\u2019t have something wrong with their brain. I\u2019m it putting those people down or saying I have it worse. I don\u2019t. Even just one day of feeling like this would be torture and i sympathize with anybody who has struggled with this. I would never an a million years wish to be a kid again and I\u2019m resentful as fuck because of it. Why is it that everybody else was able to have a decent childhood? Why couldn\u2019t I have had that? Hell, I wasn\u2019t abused, and to most people it seemed my childhood was great but no I have a stupid fucking mental illness. And the doctors were a joke too- why the fuck would you put a 6 year old on Zoloft? It never worked, and I always lied to my therapist because I was young and nobody had the decency to tell me I was there to get better. Just because I was a kid didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t understand basic social constructs- seriously, did they just expect me to talk about my feelings? Really? When somebody says how are you you don\u2019t say bad. Even kids know that. Things are better as a teen in the sense that I have more control over what I do, but mentally I don\u2019t feel any different-at all- from 4 yo me. I feel like the same person. Of course I am the same person, but I want to grow up and separate myself from that me. I just want to be happy I guess. I want to start my life but I can\u2019t. Deadass can\u2019t. My parents aren\u2019t supportive at all, and I had to quit school because of THIS MENTAL FUCKING ILLNESS. I want it gone but no amount of drugs or therapy will fix this. Despite that mentality, I\u2019m still trying. I want to grow up, I want to go to college, I want a family, I want a job, I want to be healthy. I don\u2019t see myself as happy in my perfect life, and I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m okay with not being happy. What I\u2019m not okay with this constant feeling that I\u2019m lying and no good. I\u2019m an aweful human being, but hey. Fuck I have nothing. The only thing I want is to see other people be as miserable as me. I\u2019m not even saying I have it worse than other people. I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t like seeing other people happy. Is that bad? Yea. I want people to be happy, but at the same time I want somebody to understand. I\u2019m done writing this. There\u2019s a lot more I want to say, but I\u2019m sleepy.

I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense.. hopefully it does. \nHere\u2019s my situation: both my sister and I struggle with depression. However, they take different forms. Mine takes the form of isolation and self hate as motivation. Hers takes the form of being lazy and taking risks in social situations. Both are bad, but because I\u2019m so much more productive than her, they use my achievements against her. Vise versa where they expect me to go out and be rebellious. (I really don\u2019t leave my room because of social anxiety, but this has prevented them from allowing me to get my license and taking outside classes.)\nWe both had to quit school because of depression. Like I said, mine was pushing myself too hard and hers was falling into the wrong crowds. It\u2019s like we\u2019re holding each other back because of our behaviors. I feel terrible that she\u2019s expected to do so much, and she feels bad that I can\u2019t do what other people my age do. It\u2019s really not fair at all. I also need to say my parents view my depression as more real because I was diagnosed earlier than her (I was 6 she was 12. I\u2019m 16 now and she\u2019s 15) but it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s struggling like hell right now but they\u2019re treating it like a teen thing when it\u2019s not. She needs help and I can\u2019t do anything because they\u2019re constantly comparing my behavior to hers. Were both at crossroads right now and can\u2019t do anything to help ourselves. I\u2019m also going to add the depression is genetic from my dads side,  but my mom also struggles. Bad thing is, I don\u2019t live with them.

I\u2019ll give a (kinda) quick rundown.\nMy dads family has a history of mental illness. I don\u2019t live with them, so I live with mentally healthy people. So we both struggle with depression but I guess she\u2019s more open about it or something. I constantly beg my parents to help her but they just don\u2019t get it.  They\u2019ve taken her to therapy but as people know, finding a right therapist requires trial and error in a lot of cases. Note: she\u2019s a pain in the ass to live with. Like an actual nightmare. Every day she screams at my grandparents and breaks stuff in our house - every day. \nShe obviously has a problems and I don\u2019t hate her because of it. I know she needs help. \nI just want my parents to understand how stressful this is for me. This part is selfish, I\u2019m fully aware, but she threatens pregnancy all the time and if they don\u2019t help her and she does end up pregnant (she doesn\u2019t make empty threats. I with that, u wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she kills herself) I\u2019m going to take care of her baby. That\u2019s the biggest thing I\u2019m afraid of. (They\u2019re too old to raise a baby and both of my parents have their own issues. It really would fall on me. I\u2019ve talked about it with family and they agreed with me) I also fear that when I\u2019m 18 I\u2019ll need to let her live with me. She has no skills, and she\u2019s overall... just really stupid. (Not trying to be mean.. I swear) She can\u2019t help herself because she doesn\u2019t know how to and nobody will listen to me because it\u2019s \u2018none of my business\u2019 when it really is my business. She\u2019s my sister and she deserves to have a chance. \n\nAlso adding she\u2019s 15 and this has been going on for 4 years. It all started because of this one girl that she doesn\u2019t talk to anymore. She was a happy girl before she met her but that girl.. just destroyed her. She\u2019s not in school anymore because of her and she can\u2019t do online school. She tried last year but it didn\u2019t work for her. This is another problem\nAs for myself, the only reason I go to a physiatrist is because I was required to go when I was 6 and it\u2019s never stopped. I guess they just view mine as more \u2018real\u2019 because I was so young when I was diagnosed. (I\u2019m 16 now btw) \nSo is there anything I can do? At all? I feel terrible for my grandparents... they don\u2019t deserve it. Like I\u2019ve said, they\u2019ve tried to help her but they just... suck at it. I want to help but whatever I say is invalid because I\u2019m young. \nBoth of my grandparents are to blame for this. My grandmother spoils her rotten and my grandfather doesn\u2019t know what to do. They\u2019re amazing people and I\u2019m happy I live with them, they just don\u2019t understand mental illness. \nI\u2019ll answer questions about this I just want some advice or something\nI\u2019m deleting this later", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 391440, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My sister is threatening suicide", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9k9wxf/my_sister_is_threatening_suicide/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "llumines", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_22vojbr3", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538197818, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ju1ed/are_my_parents_responsible_for_my_eating_problems/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9ju1ed", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9ju1ed/are_my_parents_responsible_for_my_eating_problems/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538197819, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sorry if this post is long but it\u2019s just something that bothers me and I\u2019d like to know if what they did was right. I know it\u2019s not really advice, but I want to know what other parents would have done and idk where to post it. Nothing abusive was done, it was more how they dealt with my mental and physical health. \nWhen I was 6, I was put on antidepressants. I obviously needed them but I\u2019m not going to get into that.. after I was put on them, I completely lost the ability to feel full. The antidepressants also took away my ability to feel emotion and I even remember they said I ate more and I stopped crying after I took the meds. They said they never stopped my eating because I was underweight. In middle school was when I gained weight - I know it was because of puberty. Anyways, I gained weight and became overweight. 9th grade was when I wanted to lose weight  but I couldn\u2019t because of the meds. It wasn\u2019t until this year that I threw a fit to my physiatrist that the meds never worked and I\u2019m off of them now, and the only reason that happened was because I quite the meds myself and started doing bad things to myself. Specifically purging and starving myself. This is important because ever since I quite my meds I\u2019ve been obsessed with weight loss because for years now my body has felt uncomfortable. I think I was supposed to be on the smaller side but because of what happened it ruined my body. Even when I was underweight my parents didn\u2019t care about my health - they just wanted me bigger. I had high cholesterol and blood sugar but I wasn\u2019t big so they didn\u2019t see a problem.  I\u2019m 16 now, I\u2019m not overweight anymore, but I have an obsession with not eating/counting calories because I\u2019m not comfortable and I feel like my parents did it to me.. The only reason they don\u2019t do anything about my dieting now isn\u2019t because of a huge lie I\u2019ve told them but for some reason they still see me as small when I\u2019m average. This is a confusing story but it just really bothers me (btw I don\u2019t purge anymore because I feel physically a lot more comfortable since I\u2019ve lost weight) but it\u2019s still painful that they never saw a problem. It destroyed my childhood because I constantly felt starved, and now that I don\u2019t feel this way I think I\u2019ve developed an eating disorder. \nI\u2019m deleting this later", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 391066, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Are my parents responsible for my eating problems?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ju1ed/are_my_parents_responsible_for_my_eating_problems/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "llumines", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_22vojbr3", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537303387, "domain": "self.college", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9gyl30/things_i_should_know/", "id": "9gyl30", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/college/comments/9gyl30/things_i_should_know/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537303387, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m only 16 but I\u2019m starting to really worry about college.

Not going to do those of course, but it\u2019s interesting to at know how much they make and stuff. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not entirely sure if this is the right thread to be posting on so.. don\u2019t bash me \n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "howto", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh69", "subreddit_subscribers": 736282, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to make and/or save money", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/9fsuym/how_to_make_andor_save_money/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "llumines", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_22vojbr3", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1536042960, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ct4j2/how_do_you_guys_view_your_family/", "id": "9ct4j2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9ct4j2/how_do_you_guys_view_your_family/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1536042961, "score": 1, "selftext": "So what i'm about to say is more geared towards adults and their feelings towards the topic. I wasn't exactly sure what subreddit to post this to, but I guess it's depression related, so I may as well post it here. I also know this is a long post, but please bare with me because its a topic that is very personal to me. \n\nIve had this problem now for a few years. I'm currently 16(F), and I feel like i'm a very selfish person for the way I've been feeling. I've never really enjoyed my life, and I've begun to start hating my family because of it. I'm not mean to them or anything, and I've never gone out of my way to make them upset. It more so takes the form of me isolating myself away from them. but with the way I view them, its like i'm also doing something terribly wrong. They are great people, and I shouldn't feel this strong resentment towards them for something they have no control over (My mental illnesses). The reason I'm posting this here is because for the past few months now, Ive been trying to set myself up for early graduation so I can leave them, and the worst part is I don't want to see them again once I leave. Its like I want them to be happy, just without myself in the picture because I was never happy while I was with them(?) its weird, but thats how I want it to be. The reason I want insight from adults though is because I want to know how you viewed your family while living with with them while dealing with mental illness - I'd also like to know if i'm seriously missing the point of being a teenager. For example: I know I should be grateful for everything that is provided for me, and being happy that i have a roof over my head ect ect. - and it really upsets me because i read another post of somebody telling another kid they have no idea what they're talking about and how they're in for one hell of a life lesson once they're an adult. I want to enjoy this last year I have with them, and i'm really afraid i'm going to miss out on this chance to be with them while I still can and it terrifies me. I don't want to grow up and cry every time I think about my adolescence. \n\nI feel like I should also add I was suicidal for the longest time. I was originally prescribed antidepressants when I was 6 ( I don't want to talk about that though. it's really painful) and That 'leaving' feeling used to take the form of me wanting to commit suicide, but ever since I started high school, its taken the form of me wanting to do my very best and leave my current life to create a better future for myself. With that, id also like to know if i'm in for some sort of life smack to the face once I become an adult. Because right now I feel like growing up is going to solve all of my problems. (I know thats not true, but I cannot get that ideology out of my head). \n\nThis part isn't relevant to the rest of the post, but I just want people to know this is my first post on reddit. I actually only made this account to talk about this issue because i loved how anonymous I could be. I would also appreciate it if people wouldn't call me names or criticize me because this was a very hard thing to write. I tried to keep it simple without going into too much detail because I really would just like to know what to expect in a few years. please remember i'm human too  ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 384007, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you guys view your family?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ct4j2/how_do_you_guys_view_your_family/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
