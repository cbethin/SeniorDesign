I've been on dates before, but can't get passed the date. Also, I've only really had a few crushes crushes, like the ones where she won't leave my mind. The last time I felt like this was when I was 18.\n\nAnyhow, this girl joined as a temporary staff member where I worked (around this time of year). Now, let me tell you, this girl was a mess. It showed. To be honest, when I first saw her, I thought she was not going to get the job. I was wrong. We got along okay. I would look up and see her staring at me. She would look up and she would see me staring at her. I started to like her. She eventually had to leave. But I built up the courage and asked for her number.\n\nWe chatted day and night. Got really personal (text). And I told her on Christmas day that I liked her. She said she liked me too. I got happy, I would finally be in my first relationship. \n\nI am shy. So I didn't see her in person again until May (saw her in December). I pick her up, and she's a mess. Her sweater is stained, her house was nasty, and her hair was nasty. I still felt like It would work. The date was meh. She was sick so I dropped her off early.\n\nWe eventually stop talking. I reach out to her during Summer and I want to hook up with her. I tell her via text. This would've changed everything. I didn't end up doing it because I was afraid... of having sex. We stop taking again\n\nFast forward to last month, I look her up on Facebook, her status: \"in a relationship.\" It broke my fucking heart. \"Why not me?\" I asked. \"Was all of this for nothing?\" It was a pretty shitty month...\n\nAnd to this day, I feel like shit sometimes. She's a mess and has nothing interesting. Why am I still hooked up on her? Is it probably  because I was so close to losing my virginity to her? Why??\n\nI'm working on myself, and to be honest, I'm having confidence issues. She still sees my stories on snapchat and when I try to connect with her, she replies in short words and a lot different than when used to talk. What advice would you have for someone like me? I want to at least stay in touch with her as friends... but that's not likely... \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 907289, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why is she tuck un my head?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9tnskj/why_is_she_tuck_un_my_head/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "ItsActualyYoTheLosr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_29na6oub", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1540848052, "domain": "self.ForeverAlone", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9she8h/how_do_virgin_people_older_than_20_stay_positive/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9she8h", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "aw", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a5e65ca0-0408-11e6-ae0b-0e4e83358591", "link_flair_text": "Advice Wanted", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9she8h/how_do_virgin_people_older_than_20_stay_positive/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1540848053, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAlone", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3yz", "subreddit_subscribers": 96208, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do virgin people older than 20 stay positive?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9she8h/how_do_virgin_people_older_than_20_stay_positive/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "ItsActualyYoTheLosr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_29na6oub", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1540847269, "domain": "self.ForeverAlone", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9sh9y9/any_forever_aloners_want_to_chat/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9sh9y9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9sh9y9/any_forever_aloners_want_to_chat/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1540847270, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm going crazy with having no social life at all.
