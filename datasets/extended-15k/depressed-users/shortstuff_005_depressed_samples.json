I\u2019ve never posted here, but I\u2019ve never felt more alone. I\u2019m reaching out because since I was diagnosed with depression this past April it feels like I\u2019ve exhausted all of my friends and family. They seem to think I\u2019m starting to get better because I can see how it\u2019s wearing on them and I\u2019m trying to hide it more. \n\nI went on a date tonight. My ex dumped me at the end of June this year. I\u2019m trying to get back out there. Being dumped wasn\u2019t the trigger for my depression, it was the abuse beforehand. But abuse for me isn\u2019t new. I just haven\u2019t realized until recently how it\u2019s been a constant in my life for as long as I\u2019ve been alive, I just never really noticed it because it was always there. The guy I went out with was so sweet, but I kept reacting out of instinct to how I wild react to the way my ex treated me and this sweet guy would assure me he wouldn\u2019t hurt me like that. Compared to him, I am so broken. And I don\u2019t want to be treated as something fragile. But I\u2019m starting to feel as though I might be. \n\nI\u2019ve been abused my whole life. I grew up in a broken home. I\u2019ve always seemed to be involved with people who treat me in the way that I am familiar with, which I have only now begun to realize is abusive. I was brought up in that way though, Being treated as such feels comfortable. I didn\u2019t know any better. It\u2019s ingrained into who I am or so it feels like. I am tired of being me.
