I only ever told her I was sad, feeling numb, bad in school, i had social anxiety etc. \nWhen I turned 16 I was diagnosed with ADHD and took medication for it, which never seemed to work at all. \n\nYesterday I told my therapist that I get paranoia, I think people can read my mind, that a demon is possessing me, that there is someone in my house. I don't leave the window open without checking underneath my bed before and after. I don't leave the door unlocked when I go to the bathroom even when I am home alone because I fear that someone might break into my house. \ni think people talk behind my back, that people secretly hate me and that I am legit cursed. \nAll of this has been going on for years since i was little. I don't do drugs, these things happen even when I am not depressed and have slept well. \n\nI told her I see, smell, hear and taste things that aren't there. My hallucinations don't happen regularly, but they so seem to make me more paranoid as time goes on, which is what led me to telling my therapist about it. My inner voices sometimes talk to each other, they whisper and I cant understand what they are saying, one time a male voice even scared me because he got loud suddenly. this one happened at night when I was trying to sleep.\nmy brain never shuts off, constant thinking and white noise, its stressing, sometimes i don't notice the white noise and thoughts until i think about them. \n\nless often i might hear a voice, as if it was real. as recently i heard a woman cry as I was waking up. One time I heard a breathing under my bed, it was a woman again. it scared me a lot, I did not know where it came from. \n\nthere is a lot more to it but that would be too much to say, my therapist got really concerned, got another woman to talk to me and she told me i should stop taking my ADHD meds first and then we will see how i feel in two weeks, to see if the meds make it worse or not. \n\nI have been crying a lot about this, as one of my favorite music artists Killed himself last year because he went through a horrible psychotic episode. He was around 50. and I fear that my hallucinations and stuff will get worse WAY worse like it did for him and that I will eventually not be able to take it anymore. Because I am extremely depressed, I am suicidal. but i love my boyfriend, and just like that singer i thought i could never ever leave them  but what if i cant control my mind. \n\nit scares me, it feels like it really has gotten worse. \nNone of my friends understand what I am going through, why i feel like things are talking to me in a language i cant understand. but i have one schizophrenic friend i am just too scared to talk to because I think what if he just thinks i seek attention? that I'm silly or stupid? \n\nmy ex was a schizophrenic and he would always sort of disregard my mental health as not so important or severe because he also had sociopathy and I dont think he quite understood i would tell him about those things because i need help not because I need attention.\n\nTL:DR: \nI show plenty of signs of developing a psychotic disorder and I am scared that it might make me end up committing suicide and that it gets worse.

When i was 14/15 I had a very happy phase. I felt happiness for the first time in my life, for a whole year i was going good and i lost weight and felt happy, my eating disorder was under control. \n\nthis wasn't caused due to my therapist, it just kind of came randomly, as i was happy with my now ex and a friend of mine helped me a lot through everything. \ni began to fall back into depression when i was 16 and all my irl friends left me. I felt alone, I still do. I havent left the house in 3 months except for like 3 appointments i had to go to. \n\nI am 17 now and I have been severly depressed again for a year now. I have all sorts of problems I have to DIAGNOSE MYSELF partly because my therapist doesnt work with me like i always read it everywhere.  she doesnt ask me questions about myself. She only asks me what i want to do now that i didnt fucking graduate because im so fucking depressed and my adhd and dyscalculia ruined my life. i dont fucking know, if i have to stay in this country and work as a cashier all my life im definitely killing myself.\n\nI diagnosed myself with an eating disorder because its incredibly obvious as i have binge eaten since i was raped as a little kid ( no one knows abt that except a few url friends, i dont plan on talking abt it), i gained a lot of weight back then but I also had phases where i would eat barely or nothing everyday. and i of course am obsessed with wanting to be skinny, when all my friends say im not fat. i dont see it, i see fat. But im not exactly skinny either. \nI was obviously badly depressed for more than 5 years now, my therapist only recently found out?? i told her causually that im depressed and she acted so surprised and my mother said \"no ur not\". \nokay just because i dont try to kill myself in the therapy office it doesnt mean im mentally fine, its obvious i have social anxiety when i get panic attacks because i dont want to be part of a social gathering, when im terrified of buying groceries etc. when i come home crying because a fairly attractive man smiled at me, and i could only think he was laughing about me, making fun of me. and when i stutter and my heart races when i get forced to talk to strangers, which i told her all about.\n its obvious that im depressed when i can feel it and it feels like real pain, and it drains me and i feel nothing and get aggressive. I even told her about how i almost attempted suicide when i was 12 years old, and i cut all over my body and hurt myself in different ways 14-15. plus i was drinking a lot of alcohol.\n im sure you all know exactly what depression and these things are like.\nand i know that people have to tell their therapist about things, but is it normal to get there and just randomly say \" hey listen i have felt the incredible urge to mutilate and kill myself for 5 years now\"? i never got the chance to get comfortable about that, i never got asked how i felt about certain things, how am i supposed to open up? \nI dont want depression medication, i want to be okay and get okay by myself and its driving me crazy i feel helpless. \n\none of my url friends told me to tell my therapist about my eating disorder, last time i finally got the courage to do so. my therapist was surprised and asked me what makes me think that, and eventually said that she will try to help me but its not that bad right now because my weight doesnt fluctuate. well of course you cant see that when i see you once or twice a month, within that goddamn month i have lost and gained weight around 7 times just because i kept on binge eating and starving myself. \n\nOne of my online friends has helped me more as a wannabe therapist in an hour, than my own therapist did in 3 years. is it my fault? He asked me all about things, i found out why i was so scared of having multiply partners, it all made sense why i was scared of abandonment. i never thought abt it that way. but he asked the right questions.\n\ni basically have no other choice than to firstly self diagnose. the only thing they cared about doing tests with me and diagnosing me was my ADHD and Dyscalculia. \ncurrently i dont know if i have body dysmorphia, i did a lot of tests and read a lot about it, everytime it was recommended to seek help. i feel pathetic when i self diagnose, because it feels like im a stupid attention whore, but i just want help and somehow im not getting it. i dont want to have mental breakdowns just because i saw myself naked in the mirror, just because i want to rip my skin off. i want to be okay with myself. \n\nam i just stupid as shit or is there really something wrong with this?\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 381351, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I feel like my therapist doesn't help me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9agfrn/i_feel_like_my_therapist_doesnt_help_me/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "AeshmaHendrix", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535117803, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/uglyduckling/comments/99xgsv/1417_lost_around_26lbs_sorry_for_the_filter_in/", "id": "99xgsv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/uglyduckling/comments/99xgsv/1417_lost_around_26lbs_sorry_for_the_filter_in/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "Uoh_c5fqKw3P_09ZTFBQl0kFThgrHT1NkEkfR2SPonI", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gkYla3lOyZkcRSGvEQENW3Jv-kvP6ti0iks4WyQpqN8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=0ddf24cfb61250b45a30f17a84d5b3a8", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gkYla3lOyZkcRSGvEQENW3Jv-kvP6ti0iks4WyQpqN8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=7ad9eb52fd2b5638a33e2426b2c0fb99", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gkYla3lOyZkcRSGvEQENW3Jv-kvP6ti0iks4WyQpqN8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=c008b90ebea95b9d80253805d25a2dfa", "width": 320}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gkYla3lOyZkcRSGvEQENW3Jv-kvP6ti0iks4WyQpqN8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=2d954294ae3b1e834781eb039d7e31ca", "width": 640}, {"height": 960, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gkYla3lOyZkcRSGvEQENW3Jv-kvP6ti0iks4WyQpqN8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=2c81b07628a0e85d812937d68c69be2f", "width": 960}, {"height": 1080, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gkYla3lOyZkcRSGvEQENW3Jv-kvP6ti0iks4WyQpqN8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=95ec29a393e760e9bba73526f371f561", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1080, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gkYla3lOyZkcRSGvEQENW3Jv-kvP6ti0iks4WyQpqN8.jpg?s=6a69873f567be0b8b9f287ec923f8fb5", "width": 1080}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1535117803, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "uglyduckling", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vz7o", "subreddit_subscribers": 75936, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yefNcE248TKPTZHXdTBSuN_yqf-PqMIk3ckzcCxVl1M.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "14-17. lost around 26lbs. sorry for the filter in the first pic and sticker in second..after all im still hella insecure lmao.

I know I really want to have sex with him, but there is something that tells me i just cant do it and I'm too scared to. when I think about actually touching it i get really angsty, even though i know i want it in some way and it drives me crazy because i don't want to be this prude i want to be sexually open but i don't know how. i don't know how to be a slut either not even towards him. i try to be a little slutty sometimes, like sending nudes but i would never be able to send him a picture of my peach. i just cant. and that's not because my private parts are especially gross or ugly, i just cant do it because i am in some way ashamed of myself. and I'm pretty sure that has a lot to do with my trauma from my childhood. I don't know if i should tell him that i might not be ready by then, or if i should get over myself because its not that bad. i know he will be gentle, i know he will be careful and patient because that's just who he is. but I'm still scared. extremely. \n\nhow do I deal with this because I cant get a therapist for it ( i wouldn't be able to tell my therapist about my trauma, she doesn't know about it ) .\n\nI also really want to lose my virginity to him, i really do. its just so incredibly hard for me to even think about", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 568925, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "fear of having sex", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8m34fy/fear_of_having_sex/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "AeshmaHendrix", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1523903510, "domain": "self.AeshmaHendrix", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AeshmaHendrix/comments/8cptin/i_hate_life_so_much/", "id": "8cptin", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/u_AeshmaHendrix/comments/8cptin/i_hate_life_so_much/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1523905814, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Im venting on here because I dont want to vent to any of my friends.

I sound so lonely and desperate I apologize\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 340360, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to find friends", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/87zrag/how_to_find_friends/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "AeshmaHendrix", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1521413980, "domain": "self.AeshmaHendrix", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AeshmaHendrix/comments/85eya3/i_made_my_friend_smile/", "id": "85eya3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/u_AeshmaHendrix/comments/85eya3/i_made_my_friend_smile/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1521474873, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "u_AeshmaHendrix", "subreddit_id": "t5_9f3oc", "subreddit_subscribers": 0, "subreddit_type": "user", "suggested_sort": "qa", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I made my friend smile", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AeshmaHendrix/comments/85eya3/i_made_my_friend_smile/"}, {"author": "AeshmaHendrix", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1515400033, "domain": "self.Anxiety", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7ox7g1/do_i_care_too_much/", "id": "7ox7g1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7ox7g1/do_i_care_too_much/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1515460555, "score": 9, "selftext": "I think I care and worry too much about people, even strangers. Im a very emotional Person and I think its a Problem because I will legit cry over someone I only know as a singer or youtuber etc. \nA good example is when I cried because of this man that had died off leukemia. Because a year ago I found a picture of him on the Internet and it inspired me to finally start writing my book, and the Main character is inspired by him. And when my friend found out who he was recently, my Main character and he had so much in common, and then I found out that man had died last year, which in my eyes made me way too emotional. \n\nOr when I get super happy over a youtuber being happy or my favorite singer. Its just weird and I feel like I have no right to be emotionally invested into any of these people because I infact dont really know them. So that worries me even more, I feel like I seem like a pretentious idiot to others and that upsets me. And I just worry too much in General.
