I am devastated and yesterday I had to call a call center urgently because I am alone and I would have preferred not to wake up the next morning without acting... I still live on the dream that one day I will be able to prove to her and that she will love me again... I feel pain and I no longer have the motivation to move forward... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Story\\]\n\nAs a child I remember not understanding why I was in trouble in many situations. I had a lot of difficulty concentrating at school and in any activity that required concentration. This has caused problems at school of course and in my social relationships. I had problems with my impulsivity in sports. \n\nMy mother would scream, she would tell me what to think, how to act and she would do things regularly for me, she would tell me what to say and she would remind me how wrong I was about my feelings and emotions. This is still the case even at 29 years of age. My father was rather platonic and he seemed frustrated or rather constantly angry with me. In my memories he harassed me with comments about what I was doing wrong, he followed me literally for several minutes to repeat the same things to me. It was his way of making me understand that I was doing something wrong, then passed the baton on to my mother, who had more authority than him in my eyes. The only way to get out of this situation was to scream louder than them by taking action to stop them. I repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated STOP, but the only thing that worked was to take concrete action, such as screaming and making a hole in a wall or breaking something nearby. \n\nOf course, with hindsight, I don't ask myself why I was very introverted in high school, in sport, and in my social life. I didn't speak or hardly spoke until I exploded with rage and couldn't take it anymore, in any context.\n\nThe older I got, the more I took a certain distance from my parents, but the less supervision there was, the more I felt unsuitable in this world. I have performed relatively well in sport, hockey and university soccer, but unfortunately my career ended badly. In hockey I was no longer up to speed, so I was released and my soccer career ended with a suspension. Another example of my mismanagement of emotions, you may say. Yes, probably.\n\nThe further away from the family home I went, the better I got. The University several kilometers and trips away probably allowed me to live my life in my own way without suffering my parents. During this period, I earned a Mention of Honor at the bachelor's level and I even obtained a master's degree afterwards, one of the most difficult things in my life. On the other hand, my love relationships have never been good. My 4 serious relationships ended on one decision of the other. I was going through the break-up. Yes 2 of his 4 were probably not compatible people but the rejection turned me completely upside down. It has been said of me that I am an eternal dissatisfied person. \n\nI didn't understand. I didn't understand why I always felt this sadness inside, why I had and felt all her problems and my difficulty in finding happiness, finding motivation, finding a direction. I was diagnosed with ADD at the age of 25.... WHAT... what to do about it. I took medication, but soon after I was left once again and lost my job... I dropped the medication that was freezing me up in an undesirable way, I would say.\n\nTime passed and I accepted myself as an ADD a little more every day, but I didn't understand the subtleties and my psychologist kept telling me to take medication. When he told me he couldn't help me anymore if I didn't take any, I decided to let him down.\n\nThere was this calmer period of my life emotionally, I had problems with my work, but I temporarily saw some girls who allowed me to maintain certain sociable relationships. I worked for a mediocre organization, but I wanted to make my point and gain ground. I was desperately looking for a soul mate who would help me to be happy. To find happiness. It didn't work, so I decided, with a friend, to go to Hawaii... You'll guess I met an angel there... The pearl descended from heaven. She lived a few blocks from my real house and we fell in love instantly. \n\nThe beginning of our relationship was magical. Flower and everything was going well! I had finally found the woman of my life. We were talking about long-term relationships, the future, children living together... On the other hand, out of concern for transparence, I wanted to warn him... I'm a problem! She said to me, don't say that! Our relationship has evolved, so has my life. My work was made unbearable, my sports injuries prevented me from moving, my mood was horrible and I transposed everything into our relationship. She suggested that I go to see a doctor, which I did right away to be able to save this relationship that I so cherished. She kept telling me, you're negative, you're not good with yourself, you're frustrated, and you scream.\n\nWith my psychologist, we assessed that all my negative, depressive and self-esteem behaviours were the result of what I was going through at work, my injury that prevented me from playing sports and moving, etc.). I worked very hard to heal my injury (physiotherapy, sports medicine and yoga). I worked very hard to change jobs and found a new job. Yes I was negative, but it felt like a change, the problems were almost solved, I could finally think for the best. However, I was not doing well. Its processes were demanding, draining and it was almost impossible for me to feel the slightest bit of happiness except that I demonstrated my willingness to change for the better. I wanted to solve my problems and finally become happy with the woman of my life.\n\nUnfortunately, everything went wrong... During a small party at our house for our new apartment for a couple I drank too much and I was mean to her. I don't remember it at all and it hurt him badly... It was the straw that broke the camel's back. She's gone. She's gone. In less than 2 weeks, she had cancelled all our commitments (lease, insurance, etc.) and moved out. The last time we saw each other, when he moved, we talked. I apologized and she understood. On the other hand, she said she had to do her best to respect herself and that she no longer had time to give me for my happiness. That she was no longer there for me, but that she had tried and really loved me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 390962, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm a problem for myself and I lost her.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9jqaih/im_a_problem_for_myself_and_i_lost_her/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
