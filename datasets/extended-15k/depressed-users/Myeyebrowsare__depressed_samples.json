I trusted her deeply as she understood some of my root with anxiety/depression. I have Ulcerative Colitis (incredibly severe case) so trying to explain why this chronic illness effects my everyday life is HARD. Most have never really heard of it before.

So the office just set me up with another psychiatrist to meet with tomorrow. \n\nI\u2019m incredibly nervous to meet with another new doctor, especially a new psychiatrist, given the severity of my chronic illness and the resulting depression/anxiety. I\u2019m scared he won\u2019t understand. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll lay out my whole life story involving this horrible disease and complications only for him to not take me seriously.

I can\u2019t lay in my bed with my eyes closed for more than 10 seconds without a deep overwhelming fear of doom overtaking me. I can\u2019t fall asleep naturally. I take Xanax, ambien, and over the counter sleepaids to try and sleep. I\u2019m tired of seeing the sunrise every morning. I\u2019m tired of watching the days waste away before me because I\u2019m so useless. I\u2019m useless from the insomnia, the depression, anxiety and lack of motivation. My chronic illness has destroyed my life, the resulting PTSD has only made it worse. \n\nI don\u2019t know where this post is going. I don\u2019t know what any comments will say. I just had to tell someone. Just let me go to sleep without having panic attacks, without having nightmares, without sleep paralysis. The day time will always be hard to tolerate but the night is becoming my enemy too. I just want to find some peace and be ok. I just can\u2019t keep doing this cycle. I want to feel at ease. Maybe it all will be if I can just trick my body into closing my eyes.
