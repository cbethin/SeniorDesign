I'm on 80mg of fluoxetine (prozac) and 200mg of lamotrigine (lamictal), because of this I have developed a huge fear of being sad, I feel like if I am sad that the medications aren't working and I will have to go through the painful part of my life again to get back on track, it's like taking the wrong turn in a diabolical forest that you just want to get out of, but once you are, you realise that you took the wrong path but you don't want to go back in.\n\nI have patches of being overwhelmed and mild depression, I say its mild because its just a slight feeling of hopelessness but no where near as bad as it was, but that's what Im scared of.\n\nI'm terrified, and I see no other way than to go back into the forest, but once your in there, you lose track of your memories, who you are and how to get out. That's depression, and that's what I might have to go through if it turns out my medication needs to be changed again.\n\nMy birthday is in a few weeks but I'm not even excited about it, I'm caught up in the moment and can't seem to look past it. \n\nAnyway rant over, I hope someone can pitch in their 2 cents in this situation for me, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 393199, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "There's a lot on my plate and just need advice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9lvw94/theres_a_lot_on_my_plate_and_just_need_advice/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
