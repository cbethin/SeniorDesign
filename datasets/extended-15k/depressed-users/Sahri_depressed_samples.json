I don't really know where and how to begin but I am having a very very bad day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband took our 2 kids (3y and 1y) to his family as our niece is having birthday and as I am not feeling to well today I stayed home. I planned to enjoy this day with doing nothing and gaming all day but I find myself feeling utterly shit and depressed. I am depressed already for a very very long time but only around 3 years ago (a few months after giving birth to our son) I was diagnosed with depression as things turned very bad very quickly. Since then I am taking medication and just a few days ago I started some new drugs (again, it's the 5th different kind now) and I am losing hope.\n\nI have a very hard time being alone with my kids as I have a very low stress tolerance and I get stressed out, anxious and get panic attacks very quickly if things are not going smoothly. I have no one to help me when I feel shit. The kids go to daycare and my husband comes home from work later when I had already picked them up.\n\nI have no one. I am alone all day. We are living in his home country (we lived in another country before, where we met, then moved here) and my family lives in my home country. I have no friends as I am so anxious, have 0 self esteem or confidence. Well, I have one friend but she has a baby as well and a lot of her own stuff to deal with. Husbands family lives half an hour drive away (we dont have a car) and usually can only help maybe once a week with picking up one kid from daycare. They also recently got a health issue on their own so also can't ask them for help much, which makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I do all day is sleeping and nothing. Maybe playing some computer games. I am constantly dead tired that I get up in the morning and an hour or so later I am so tired I have to lie down again. I have no energy to do all the household things that need to be done or do anything else really. I have absolutely no interest in anything anymore and it's very hard getting myself out of the house. We live in a little town and without car you can't really get anywhere. There is a trainstation where I can get to the city but..what am I supposed to do there really..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what I actually wanted to write about but after not having done it for nearly 16 years I cut myself today because I feel so awful I did not know what else to do with myself. I want to go out and buy cigarettes (I stopped smoking in 2012) but I can't get myself to put on clothes and go out of the house. I don't want my husband to come home with the kids either, but I also don't want to be alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last many days I just feel that I just don't want to live anymore. I don't want to be the one that ends my life, I just don't want to be anymore. I have nothing to look forward to. I have no reason to get out of bed. I have no job (I also can't work atm), I don't speak the language here so well (I do a little bit but it's not enough) and I have no mental space to learn it more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have recently, while playing my computer games, met a guy I am talking to everyday now. What started as just talking turned into flirting and all that good stuff. We exchange pictures of ourselves or what we are doing etc, he makes me feel so fucking special and happy and I noticed I'm getting a bit annoyed when my husband is around, that I can't freely talk to guy.\n\nI absolutely love my husband. We are married for 1,5 years but are together for almost 10 years now. What I feel when talking with this guy are feelings I have not felt in many many years. The butterflies, the just genuine happiness, being excited when getting a new message. Talk into the late hours.. all that stuff. It gets to the point where we are talking a bit more naughty in the late hours and joke about meeting and getting more into that. Talking like that is super exciting and I feel like I really want to do that.  I know if my husband would find out how I am talking to guy, he would be so super upset and sad and angry and what not, and I would be too if I would be in the opposite position. But, I know that nothing is ever gonna happen because I don't want to cheat on my husband, guy lives in a different country, and I am just not attractive at all. My husband does not have a reason to ever be jealous about anyone having an sincere interest in me. \n\nI mean, I can make somewhat okay/cute pictures of myself but my body is a whole other story. So ever ever meeting guy would probably end up in him running away screaming anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd still no idea what I am actually trying to say, but I have not talked about this with anyone..as I have no one. \n\nBut, what I feel when talking to guy is actually what I want to feel with my husband. Since the birth of our first we had exactly 3 dates where we would go out in the evening, watch a movie or so and then go back home. We never get to do anything either just us two or us as a family because husband is tired after work and in the weekend. We have no car so getting around with 2 little kids is more stress than fun. It seems that there is absolutely no romance or intimacy left anymore. I kept telling him how I feel and that I need more but nothing really changes and I just don't have the energy or motivation to keep trying and trying anymore.\n\nSo that's why I now cling to guy to give me them butterflies and make me feel special. So today husband left with kids and I looked forward playing and talking to guy but he was too busy with other things and now I feel so absolutely shit.\n\nIn this computer game I joined a guild (guys guild) and the people are so nice and friendly and fun to talk to, but especially today I could just not find my way into getting anyone to play with me, which made me feel so sad and lonely because not even in an damn computer game anyone wanted to spend time with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, Husband is not giving me what I need/want, guy is not giving me what I need/want, I have no family to go visit or to come over, my friend is always super busy too. I am just alone. All the time. And I can't take it anymore.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my husband is not some asshole that doesn't care. He is so patient and tries really hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have so many bad feelings, I feel so shit so often and so long and I also want to talk about it, but seriously, who wants to hear that? No one wants to hear from another person how shit things are, how hopeless everything is and how nothing is really getting any better. I mean, even if you really care for a person and how they feel, you can't really help anyways. Just saying that you are sorry things are shit is nice but it doesn't actually help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt feels a bit better now after typing all this shit out, but I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to keep dealing with all this and how to find any kind of happiness anymore. It's been so so so so so long that I had just been happy. I am not sure that all this holding on and trying is worth it anymore..  \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 403972, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm not sure how to keep holding on", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9vvf6x/im_not_sure_how_to_keep_holding_on/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_61s13", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1540773257, "domain": "self.shameless", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/shameless/comments/9s8e4x/spoiler_season_9_happy_ending/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9s8e4x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/shameless/comments/9s8e4x/spoiler_season_9_happy_ending/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1540773258, "score": 1, "selftext": "Just stumbled upon this... i'm so excited!?

So husband is getting up at 6, wakes the kids, makes them ready and brings them to daycare+kindergarden before he has to leave for work with the train at 7.\n\n\nToddlerdude is a morninggrump (just like me..) and he gets very easy upset and starts crying and throwing a fit when it's time to dress and get out of the house. I can understand that, it's fairly early and getting out of the warm pyjamas sucks, but I really want to make these mornings easier for him. There is usually a lot of drama until both kids are finally in the biketrailer and drive up to kindergarden.\nThey are getting breakfast in kindergarden together with the other kids, they love that and have a lot of fun there. Toddlerdude usually does not want to go home when I pick them up later in the day, so he is having a blast in kindergarden and gets to spend a lot of time and energy with his friends.\n\n\nI just want to find a way to make it easier on him in the morning. It stressed dad out a lot that he is crying and so upset, and he does not have a lot of time to get them ready and out of the house as he has to be at the train at 7. Train to the city only goes every hour so he can't miss that one. I usually get up too and help getting one of them ready.\nBreakfast at home is not an option due to the time pressure and we don't want to get them up even earlier. Littledude is not napping anymore. Also, breakfast early is also a bit difficult with him as he is so grumpy that he does not want breakfast and just throws a fit and is angry until it is time to leave and then he wants breakfast.\n\n\n\n\nDo you have any ideas what we can do to help the little man? The 1y old is usually fine, she is always superhappy and she just gets a bit upset if she is being lied down to put on her wintersuit and hat, but will then lighten up again as soon as she is picked up.\n\n\n\nAnd if you have any ideas how to get my 1y old not to wake so often during the night, that would be a bonus! Littledude never did that in that age, he got a bottle once a night until he just stopped waking for food in the night, so he was a around 1year when that happened.\n1y old though wakes at 11pm and then around 2am and sometimes at 5am. I tried watering down the formula or just giving water or just snuggle and back to bed but nothing works, she will just freak out if she doesn't get a proper bottle and will just cry and cry and cry. \n\n\nThey are super adorable though!!\n\nThanks!\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Parenting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "subreddit_subscribers": 456565,

Had a scan yesterday and little baby Emma is absolutely fine and the only problem is my bloodpressure. They recommended yesterday that I should stay in the hospital to be monitored and getting medication for the bloodpressure but unfortunately it could not really be stabilized properly. \n\n\n\nInstead of waiting and seeing the bloodpressure getting higher and higher and risking to get preeclampsia in the last 2 weeks they said it is safer for the baby and me to start inducing today. \ud83d\ude29\n\n\n\nSo now currently waiting to be moved into another room (thankgod, another lady just mover into my room and she is breathing very loud and snores!!) and will then discuss everything with the midwife. Husband is also bringing our 2 year old to daycare and will then have to pack me a hospital bag and stuff for little baby Emma. Just 2 days ago we talked about we should pack soon! Well, surprise motherfucker!\n\n\n\nI'm a bit worried as I was induced with my son too and it took a loooong time and was very painful. It is also 2 weeks early but my midwife said that the baby is fine and 2 weeks early is fine for the baby and safer than getting preeclampsia. \n\n\n\nSo, cross your fingers that it doesn't take too long!

For once, he will refuse meat. I only use beef or chicken meat and sometimes fish, but he won't touch it, or if it is a saucy dish with chicken in it and he gets a piece of chicken in his mouth, he will spit it out and dinner is ruined. He will push away his plate and refuse to eat any more of it, even if we take the chicken out.\n\n\nWe have a little bit of success now after I bought chicken nuggets in dinosaur shape and he will eat a few bites of it, but never get him to eat a whole one.\n\nHe also started being super pickish with vegetables. He liked to eat broccoli but nowadays it's a no-no. Carrots he never liked, so he will ignore them. He does eat peas and cucumber but pretty much anything else he refuses, he doesn't even want to try any new things or things we had previously success or not with.\n\n\nHe ate rice just fine but started refusing it as well. Noodles sorta work if there is a good sauce with it (creamy cheesy sauce always works, tomato sauces not so much). He also previously liked potatoes in fries-shape, as mashed potatos, fried with onion and garlic or anyhow really, but now they are also not very interesting anymore.\n\n\nIf I make any sweet dishes (we don't really add lots of sugar in those, either none or just a tiny bit and served with fruitmash/sauce/jam) like porridge, grie\u00dfkoch (some austrian yummy dish made of semolina and milk), pancakes, milkrice etc. he eats without any problems and a lot of it, but anything else is very hard to get him to eat.\nMy thought is that he likes the sweet things a lot (which I understand) but even when we did not make any sweetish dishes in a long time, the problems with the \"normal\" food continued and did not get any better, and I have the feeling he does not eat enough for dinner. He never wakes up in the night and is hungry or anything, he is also right on track on his growing, so I don't think it is that much of a problem growing-wise but I'm concerned about the missing nutrition if he doesn't get meat enough or different vegetables etc.\n\n\n\nAre there any tricks I can get him to eat better or try new things?\nI obviously don't want to force him to eat if he really doesn't want as I don't want him to associate dinnertime with being traumatic/annoying/parents force me to. We try a couple of times and if he really doesn't want anymore, we let him go play. Sometimes if I have the feeling he hasn't eaten enough all day, I will ask him if he wants to eat something else like bread or a bun or anything and he will get it if he says yes. But we can't really make a habit out of that, that he just refuses dinner and I will have to go and make him something else. I don't plan on cooking 3-10 different kinds of foods every day for dinner. \n\n\nI am also due to giving birth in 3 weeks to our second child and I really can't have these dinner-fights any longer.\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you have some tips for me! :)\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Parenting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "thumbnail": "self", "title":

There's some kind of healthwalk through the forest, so it would take longer home but be fun. \n\nWe walked around 20minutes in the forest and could already hear from far that they are cutting trees with large machines. Then we got to the machine which took up the entire walkway and a giant truck with 2 giant hangers where all the hacked wood was thrown in from the machine. \n\nThere was literally no way around it as it was in the woods and the machine and trucks took up the whole little road and were around 20meters long if not more. On the sides of the road were just too many trees and little rivers so there was no way i could get the biketrailer by (just walked with the biketrailer). \n\n\nWe waited a bit and watched but they did not move to let us through (they were really huge!!) so we had to turn around and go back out the forest, back to the street and get home there. \n\n\nMy fiance was already on the way home with his bike from work so I called him and as soon as he picked up I broke into tears and asked if he can come and get us. He got super worried and thought something happened and if me and the little dude are okay. My answer was \"yes we are fine. Im just pregnant\" and kept crying. \n\n\nHe saved us though. It only took 2 hours to get home from picking up my son until we arrived home. But he enjoyed to watch the big woodcutting machine immensely and walking home with daddy was also much better. \n\n\nDamn hormons!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BabyBumps", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7cl", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Today I cried because...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/6bg709/today_i_cried_because/", "view_count": null}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492867151, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/femalehairadvice/comments/66vwt0/i_need_a_new_shorter_haircut_that_fits_me_and/", "id": "66vwt0", "is_self": false, "link_flair_css_class": "hairstyles", "link_flair_text": "Hairstyle Advice", "locked": false, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/femalehairadvice/comments/66vwt0/i_need_a_new_shorter_haircut_that_fits_me_and/", "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "B3-7S1XvsGrl1oDUvntPtZY87bNZxvX2e_hBz_7gIXk", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/mu2GySDP134J82Pyfo1uUhWRl1AfhQ2-Blkxf9N9c3c.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=11cb4cb7659aff1b7760611c5d13da54", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/mu2GySDP134J82Pyfo1uUhWRl1AfhQ2-Blkxf9N9c3c.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=9ca81d8c19db4401824a6793d491908b", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/mu2GySDP134J82Pyfo1uUhWRl1AfhQ2-Blkxf9N9c3c.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=3cba5fa3e0ff0c7a1ba3e72e0b0fb9c9", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/mu2GySDP134J82Pyfo1uUhWRl1AfhQ2-Blkxf9N9c3c.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=8e261f1bdabb18f435d597727cf8d3bc", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/mu2GySDP134J82Pyfo1uUhWRl1AfhQ2-Blkxf9N9c3c.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=679b44e351924a4ea99f69815b433671", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/mu2GySDP134J82Pyfo1uUhWRl1AfhQ2-Blkxf9N9c3c.jpg?s=264840ce79def69d077bd3bd063d8e9e", "width": 960}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1494622753, "score": 6, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "femalehairadvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sgxv", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/SMsNPigH7CPsR8ShLUsnUOLKUPz-faOWeccp-ck4CZo.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "I need a new, shorter, haircut that fits me and looks good when getting married (in june!).

I am a stay-at-home mom at the moment until I find a job and little dude goes to daycare monday-friday. It's a small daycare and they are only 5 kids there. He loves it there.\n\nWhenever he is home alone with me, it is absolutely horrible most of the time. He constantly cries or screams if things don't go his way (I know, it's fairly normal but it happens a lot..). Lately he started hitting me and throwing things at me (mostly heavy and/or hard things like wooden stuff). I tell him no, put it away or put him down etc. but he just doesn't seem to care. Of course explain to him too that this is not nice etc. but he keeps doing it. Once i was lying on the floor and he had a wooden hammer for some hammering toy and came over to me and I just managed to say \"now don't throw that at..\" and the hammer went right into my face, thanks dude.\n\nHe wants up to me constantly when I'm doing something in the kitchen. If I don't pick him up he will scream and cry and throw a tantrum but it never stops. I tried telling him to wait, telling him no, give him something to play but it doesn't matter. He wants up right now!\nOther times when he is upset, he wants up so I pick him up, then he gets angry at me and screams at me and pushes away to get down, so I put him down and then he screams and cries at me because how dare I put him down if he wants to be up! And that just goes on and on like this.\n\nLately he also started refusing food. Often he doesn't eat breakfast or dinner, or inbetween. He often refuses water. He started refusing bread. If I give him buttered bread, he will lick off the butter and throw the bread away. He eats cheese, sausage, cucumbers, fruits etc without problem, but bread? Nope!\nI had been standing in the kitchen an hour to cook some awesome dinner for us, he didn't even try and just started to cry. I then continued eating my own plate and then after a while of crying and screaming he took his plate and ate a couple of spoons and then it started all over again. That was then the point he did not eat anymore. I tried to make him some toasted bread with butter (all time favorite..until now) and just looking at it he started screaming and crying.\n\nHe is doing this (except the food, he does that to his dad as well) pretty much only to me. He doesn't hit anyone or throws things at them or screams and yells so much. He does it to me only. I am at a point now where I get absolutely depressed when I am alone with him because I feel to not be worth much as I am being yelled at all the time.\n\nI am currently taking medication for depression and anxiety and on top of that I am pregnant with our second baby and I feel I can't take it anymore. The daycare is closed next week due to holidays and I absolutely dread this week. I don't want to anymore and I have no idea how to handle it and him. The last 3 days around the end of the day when I start making him ready for bed I feel so completely empty and just do it all on autopilot. I don't sing to him anymore and don't talk much to him anymore, I feel completely disconnected to this little awesome dude I spent so much time with, that now treats me like a piece of sh*t. I often think about leaving and just going back to my family (living in another country). I mean, I'm not gonna do it but it crosses my mind that it would fix this problem for me..\n\nWhen I ask other parents for some tips, they can't really give me any because they haven't had problems like this before. It seems everyone has these awesome happy kids and I have a little demon boy that wants to eat my soul.\n\nSorry if this is all over the place, I just put him to bed after being yelled at for half an hour so.. meh. :)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Parenting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My 16month old is giving me a really hard time lately, not sure how to handle it anymore", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/5t96ln/my_16month_old_is_giving_me_a_really_hard_time/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": "caroline", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1457961055, "domain": "self.StardewValley", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/4ad0ow/animals_eating_crops/", "id": "4ad0ow", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "help", "link_flair_text": "Help", "locked": false, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/StardewValley/comments/4ad0ow/animals_eating_crops/", "retrieved_on": 1463469884, "score": 3, "selftext": "So I was wondering if my animals (ducks, chickens, cows..) will eat my planted crops?\nI'd rather not have walls around everything, it really annoys me, but if they eat my crops, then I'm gonna be mad.

I had made several posts here about his awful sleeping and that is still not solved. It is so fucking hard to get him to sleep during the day that he constantly doesn't get enough naps or long enough naps.\n\nAnyways, SO had been with me all the time as he doesn't work yet. We moved into this country in June last year and basically living off our savings. I have an incredible hard time handling our little guy. He is the most adorable cute thing ever, but I just don't know how to be a mum.\nIn the start I had troubles doing the diapers but it got a bit easier now. Breastfeeding only really worked a little bit (only side-laying position, had to use nippleshields for a month to get it to work at all, and 80% of the time he just didn't want breastfed at all and we had to feed bottle), and a couple of days ago I stopped.. or well, I'm about to stop and just do less and less now.\nPlaying with him is also a thing.. I don't know how to. I feel he gets bored when I just rangle silly toys at him all the time. I'm not the singing person so singing to him is something i can absolutely not do. I tried but it's just not me.\n\nSO has been gone over night the first time as he was watching the superbowl with his friends and I was on my own. He asked me if its okay and I said yes, we will be fine. But hell was I wrong. Everything went to shit. \nWhen SO left, LO needed a nap so he was put into the trolley (because he won't sleep at home, it requires a trolley ride for the whole nap time) and I could not get him to sleep at all. Then he wriggled his arms out of the voksibag (giant sleepingbagish thing you put the baby in) which means there will not be any sleeping as he will keep eating his hands and keeping himself awake. Then he scooted further into the bag so half his head was in the bag so I had to get back home after like 5 minutes.\nAt home then no sleeping for another 2 hours (he had been awake already 3 hours prior) so he was absolutely overtired (as usually) and it took ages getting him to sleep and then the first 2 hours he woke up every 15 minutes or so. \nHe is then also a very fucking fussy eater with the bottles and will only eat in a particular way.. like.. holding him awkward in your arm and feeding him while WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE...yes, with an 8kg baby. This is absolutely impossible for me, my hands are hurting and I can't do it longer than a couple of minutes.\nFor sleeping he requires the magic merlin sleepsuit otherwise he keeps himself awake with his startling or just general flailing with all his bodyparts and trying to eat them, and he also recently figured out how to roll onto his belly so he does this all the time.\nHe does not sleep in a crib at the moment. We have a 2 story house and we had to move downstairs into the living room to sleep as it does not get more than 15degrees celsius upstairs and there is draft, and lucky us our landlord doesn't do shit and is absolutely useless, so half the house can't be used due to coldness. \n\nWe moved our double mattress down and a singlebed sized mattress for LO and we're sleeping on the floor on those. He can't roll around in the sleepsuit so it's pretty safe.\nOf course in the night I had to change his diaper so I did it in the room as getting him to the changing table in the bathroom will just rile him up again, yeah..while changing him he pissed and his sleepsuit got soaked in pee so I couldn't use this anymore. Then I spent 30minutes making the bed somewhat secure for him to sleep without harming himself.\n\nNight he kept waking up but we made it. Now in the morning we went to the changing table, started changing and of course as soon as I opened the diaper, pee everywhere. And start over again.\n\nI put him in his chair so I could feed our cats that spent the whole night yelling through the house and keeping me awake, made a formula bottle for him and went to feed him..but nope! Now he refuses to eat. He is hungry and keeps trying to eat but he just stops and is upset. He is also already fucking tired again as he is being awake already for over 2 hours but now I can't get him to either eat or sleep, he just keeps crying and yelling at me and I'm completely at the end what to do.\nI have no idea how to soothe him or how to entertain him or how the fuck to get him to sleep or to eat now. He just refuses everything. If I put him on his playground he of course has to roll onto his belly all the time and then whines because he is too tired to lie on the belly..\n\nI have no idea how to mum. I feel like I have zero mother instincts and I can't care for him. He is just crying and yelling and clearly wants me to do something but I can't figure out what it is and how to do it. It is raining like mad outside so I can simply not go for a 2 hour walk with him now and there is no way to get him to sleep inside, especially not when he is hungry, but he also won't eat. \nAnd no, there are no medical issues with him, he had been checked several times, he is apparently just a \"happy baby\". So yeah.\nI'm completely at a loss here and I feel like I just don't have it in me to be a mum. I have no idea what to do when SO starts going to work again.\nIt would probably be better for everyone if I'd just left so they can find someone better to replace me..\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "beyondthebump", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u06v", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don't know how to mum..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/44q4y6/i_dont_know_how_to_mum/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1452418874, "domain": "self.beyondthebump", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/40apsp/and_here_i_am_again_with_my_sons_major_sleeping/", "id": "40apsp", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 31, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/beyondthebump/comments/40apsp/and_here_i_am_again_with_my_sons_major_sleeping/", "retrieved_on": 1454990413, "score": 6, "selftext": "Hello again.\n\nI think this is now my 3rd post about how extremely difficult it is to put our little guy to sleep. Be it a nap or the end of the day going to bed. He is 3 months and a bit now.\n\nI really don't know anymore what to do, I'm sitting here crying because he clearly fail as parents as we are unable to help our baby to sleep.\n\n\nIt does not matter what we try. As soon as the first sign of tiredness comes we try to get him to bed quickly. Checking if a change needs to happen, if he needs food, anything and then off to bed. Nope.\nWe can rock, bounce, sing, cuddle, go for a walk in the trolley, having him in the ergo, in his swing-thingy chair, white noise,  no white noise, calm baby music, silence, dark room, lighter room, with blanket, with magic merlin sleeping suit, trying to reset the situation by getting him up again and to bed a bit later, trying to let him fall asleep by himself (that's just not happening!) it is impossible.\nHe just cries and screams as soon as we do anything that is in some way related to sleeping and with each day (and each post I made) it gets worse and worse.\n\nWe have a nurse that comes here every month to check up on him (thats a thing here in Denmark) and she (and our doctor) said that he is absolutely healthy, grows perfectly and no problems, and it's just his temperament and how he is. But what the hell are we gonna do with that? I'm completely at my end by now because we just can't get him to sleep. And if we get him to nap during the day (which doesn't happen very often..) it takes us at least 2-3 hours until we have him down, and then he is back up again after 30min.\n\n\nHe is permanently absolutely overtired because we just can't get him down, then he sleeps just a little and it's impossible to get him back down to sleep more, then he is even more tired..and it just goes like that every.fucking.day.\nThe last 2 nights he woke up every 1-1,5 hours and needed food. Yesterday he slept a stretch of 4 hours but then was up again very often. If we can get him to bed for the night it's _usually_ easier during the day to get him back to sleep but.. I really don't know what to do anymore.\n\nWe are both so fucking tired all the time because we can't get any sleep, we don't have any time for each other, we don't even have time to eat. Seriously. Little guy is keeping us from having our 3 proper meals a day.\nWhen we get up (usually at around 8) we only get to have time for breakfast at 1-2pm as he seems to need our constant attention, so the time when we can actually get him to sleep is the time where we can, briefly, be our normal selfs and eat something or take a shower or go to the toilet, so we have rarely attempted to have him in the ergo on us to sleep his 2ish hours for his naps because it means that we then still have no time to do any normal adult human being thing.\n\nI thought maybe it's the 4 month sleep regression earlier, but we are having these problems already for a long long time and it did never get any better, just worse.\n\n\nWhen we go for the trolley he _usually_ falls asleep very quickly but as soon as we stop, he wakes up and cries. It does not matter how long we walk around, it happens every time. We have now minus degrees so we can't run around out there too long either. And SO took him for a ride today and it did not work at all and he was just screaming and screaming, and since he got back home and we try to get him to sleep already over an hour went past, so little guy is up for over 3 hours again and so fucking tired. He keeps rubbing his eyes and makes his normal \"im tired\" crying and we just can't seem to help him.\nNursing him to sleep or just giving the boob to sooth him is also not working as our little gentlemen refuses the boob very harshly during the day, I'm lucky he takes it in the night...\n\nI don't know, sometimes now I feel that just want to leave and have my old life back. Would never do that, but the thought of \"it would be much easier if..' comes up fairly often in these difficult times.. :/\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "beyondthebump", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u06v", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "And here I am again with my sons major sleeping issues..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/40apsp/and_here_i_am_again_with_my_sons_major_sleeping/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1451817032, "domain": "self.breastfeeding", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/3z9e49/can_only_breastfeed_in_one_position_and_baby_also/", "id": "3z9e49", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/breastfeeding/comments/3z9e49/can_only_breastfeed_in_one_position_and_baby_also/", "retrieved_on": 1454970241, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nSo my little guy is now 3 months old and ever since he was born and we finally could start on breastfeeding (2 weeks NICU so start wasn't good) we could only get it to work in the side laying position and only with nipple shields (we are rid of those by now, yay). Whenever I try any other positions it just doesn't work and he starts crying and screaming until we go back to side laying. I really would like to nurse him differently but he just refuses..\n\nAs I spent most of my days lying around on my sides for hours over hours it started to hurt on my hips and I just got stressed out about the breastfeeding. After having talked to our nurse that visits us every month or so, I started to pump during the day and we feed bottles (sometimes formula if there is not enough breastmilk) and I breastfeed in the night in side laying.\n\nI try to throw in at least one breastfeeding session during the day because I want to, but it doesn't work at all anymore. Whenever we try he starts crying and we have to get a bottle.\n\nThe last couple of weeks now also when little one wakes up and is ready for the day (around 7-8am ish) he absolutely refuses to breastfeed in the morning. He wakes up and is frickin hungry but he does not want the boob, at all. He latches on, sucks once, stops and cries. There is no way to get him to eat. Pick him up, calm him, everything fine and put him back besides me and the crying concert starts again. The only solution is to get up and get him a bottle.\nWe had this once in the middle of the night too where he refused to breastfeed and then bottle needed to be fed, but the other days breastfeeding in the night works just fine.\n\nMy guess is that he is preferring the bottle, but I don't understand why he has no problem with the boob in the nights though (except for this one time..). But I'm getting worried that at some point I won't be able to breastfeed at all anymore because he just doesn't want me anymore.\n\nI seem to be producing enough milk. When I pump I usually get around 150ml total, which is pretty much around how much he eats from the bottle. When breastfeeding though he only uses one boob. After one boob he usually stops by himself with the satisfied-full look and falls asleep. \nA nursing session the first 1,5 month with nipple shield took around 30-45 minutes and after that when he finally managed to latch without nipple shield it went down to 5-15 minutes, mostly around the 5-7 minutes mark. This seemed to be fine during the days but while it still worked, but now in the night he usually wakes up again after 1,5-2 hours and is hungry. \n\nDo you have any ideas how to tackle this? To be honest though, I enjoy that I don't _have_ to breastfeed every single feeding and Dad is happy to take over during the days with bottles, so I still want to do breastfeeding and bottles.. but not stopping either completely and I would like to not be screamed at when I try to breastfeed.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "breastfeeding", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rdj4", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can only breastfeed in one position and Baby also starts refusing the boob..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/3z9e49/can_only_breastfeed_in_one_position_and_baby_also/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1450116198, "domain": "self.beyondthebump", "edited": 1450117058, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/3wt9vo/update_to_how_the_do_i_get_my_baby_to_sleep/", "id": "3wt9vo", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/beyondthebump/comments/3wt9vo/update_to_how_the_do_i_get_my_baby_to_sleep/", "retrieved_on": 1454928343, "score": 2, "selftext": "Original post was: https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/3upto6/how_the_do_i_get_my_baby_to_sleep/\n\nWanted to thank everyone for their tips and suggestions, I tried pretty much everything that was suggested.\nThe sleeping problem lasted around 1 week and then suddenly we could get him to nap during the day with the help of the Magic Merlin Sleepsuit and he often, but not always, slept 4 hour stretches during the night with a feed and change in between.\nI also got the app Wonder Weeks that everybody was raving about and according to it, there was a leap during the time he had the sleep issues and they cleared up also according to app timeline.\n\nIt all seemed to be going well..for a couple of days.\nNow it starts all over again that he barely sleeps during the day. Before, the Merlin Suit was a hit, we could put him in, put him on the sofa and he fell asleep and slept for 2-4 hours. Now? Nothing.\nIf we can get him to sleep he sleeps for max 30 minutes to 1 hour and after that is awake again for several hours, being fucking tired and cries about everything.\n\n\nHis sleep today went like this:\nFrom yesterday 21:17 he slept 4:21h\n\n\n01:34 1:46h\n\n\n03:36 1:01h\n\n\n05:32 2:06h\n\n\n11:46 22min\n\n\n15:25 29min\n\n\n17:44 45min\n\n\n\n\nWhenever we try to put him down he starts crying and today since 8am in the morning he also absolutely refuses the boob. I nursed him on the left side, then changed to right and since then he absolutely refuses. He is fucking hungry but as soon as the boob is there, he starts screaming and crying. We had that a couple of times before when he was overtired (because he wouldn't fucking sleep..) and we gave him a bottle instead. Now, the whole day he refuses to be nursed and we have to bottlefeed with pumped and formula and he keeps falling asleep because he is too tired, but take the bottle away or put him somewhere to sleep, he wakes up and drama starts all over again.\n\nAlso picking him up and rocking him and do pretty much everything one can try is not helping anymore either, he.just.refuses.to.sleep.\nHe also keeps starring at every little bit of lightsource he can find, if it is completely dark he gets angry and cries, if there is light somewhere he will stare at it and not get tired anymore.\n\nWe tried babywearing, nursing, just cuddling, bottlefeeding, rocking, walking, talking and humming, lights on, lights off, with magic sleepsuit and without, tried in the living room on sofa, in bedroom on bed, in crib, pacifier (he refuses pacifiers since weeks already, no chance to get him to use them anymore)... it does not matter, he doesn't sleep. It's now 7pm and he slept 7 hours over the whole day since 0:00.\n\nHe does not seem sick or in pain or anything. He has plenty wet and dirty diapers and gains weight normally. He looks at his favorite wallstickers and lights up, smiles, talks to them, tries to touch them, same with us. The mobile is also a hit still, tummytime no problem.. but sleep? NOPE.\n\n\nMe and SO are completely done with our nerves, we start snapping at each other and argue because we are fucking frustrated and feel like absolute failures because he just doesn't sleep and is overtired and grumpy and wants to sleep..he tries to rub away that annoying thing that makes his eyes tired.. and nothing fucking works and we don't get any damn sleep anymore either. We don't get any fucking food and have problems staying hydrated because he just doesn't let us get a single minute..\n\n\nWhile yesterday it somewhat worked to pick him up and rock him until he falls back to sleep and put him down again, he slept a bit more until he woke up crying again...it completely fails today.\nI spent some time on the sofa with him today where I tried to nurse, which he absolutely refused and screamed bloddy murder, and changed to a bottle while still lying side by side with him, he fell asleep after 20ml but after 22minutes suddenly wide awake and grumpy.\n\nSO is currently in bedroom with him and a bottle trying to get him to sleep but it doesn't work..\n\nI slowly get the feeling that I can't do that any longer..\n\nEdit: He's 9weeks4days now.\n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "beyondthebump", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u06v", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update to How the **** do I get my baby to sleep?!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/3wt9vo/update_to_how_the_do_i_get_my_baby_to_sleep/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1448808858, "domain": "self.beyondthebump", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/3upto6/how_the_do_i_get_my_baby_to_sleep/", "id": "3upto6", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 28, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/beyondthebump/comments/3upto6/how_the_do_i_get_my_baby_to_sleep/", "retrieved_on": 1450630063, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI am really out of ideas by now. Since a couple of days our 7week old started to not want to sleep anymore, be it naps or sleeping in the night.\nHe usually falls asleep during/after feeding and is then either left sleeping on the boob or put into his lift or his babyswing and that was it. He took several naps a day like that and we usually put him down for the night at around 8pm and that _usually_ worked without _much_ fuss and he slept 3-5 hour stretches with 1-2 feedings in the night.\n\nNow since a couple of days it is impossible to get him to sleep. During the day he will just fight it and will start crying as soon as he is put into his lift, bed, sofa, anywhere. He will only fall asleep with feeding (either bottle or boob) but as soon as you try to wriggle yourself away or put him into his sleeping place he will be wide awake and start crying.\nAs far as I could read on the mighty interwebz and as I heard from our doctor etc. babies are usually not longer awake than 2-3 hours. He is now up for almost 9 hours and refuses to sleep. Could only get him to nap twice where he woke up from nap 1 after 15 minutes and nap 2 after 45 minutes.\n\nMy SO has lumbago or something with his intervertebral discs (is that called this? english is not my native language..) and can not move, so I have to take care of him, our 4 cats, our little guy and myself and I simply have no time to lie around for hours and hours without even being able to go to pee or get us food or something to drink. As soon as I leave the baby, he will cry.\n\nSame problem with putting him down for the night now. It takes us hours to get him to sleep, it usually ends up me having to nurse him in our bed and let him fall asleep and then somehow wriggle out of bed to get up again and make dinner, eat, clean up and do whatever needs to be done, but he usually wakes again after 1-2 hours.\n\nI am absolutely exhausted and I don't know anymore what to do to get him to sleep. He hates swaddling, absolutely hates. We can rock him and he can fall asleep on us but as soon as he is put down, he is awake again. Can bottle/nurse him to sleep but as soon as he is put down, he is awake again. We always make sure that everything fixable is fixed (hungry, diaper, too cold/warm,..). Reflux and gas was ruled out too already and we usually also used white noise to get him to fall asleep, which does nothing anymore either.\nI don't know why suddenly it is such a big problem, this hasn't happened before and now it is such a struggle.\n\nThat little guy is absolutely miserable because he is so fucking tired but is too tired to sleep or just does not want to. He cries and little tears are running down his cheek and it breaks my heart. I feel like such a failure. I fail him because I can't fix this. \n\nI just had him upstairs in our bed and nursed him until he fell asleep and managed to wriggle myself out. He slept exactly 56 minutes and was then crying again. He didn't need a change and was not interested in food and he did not seem to cold or too hot. I took him downstairs with me and but him in his vibrating swing with his duvet, and let him look at a mobile and he now just went out after 10 minutes, but looking at the time..he will very soon be up again because he will be hungry and needing a change, and then it will again be impossible to get him to sleep.\n\nWhat do I do? :/\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "beyondthebump", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u06v", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How the **** do I get my baby to sleep?!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/3upto6/how_the_do_i_get_my_baby_to_sleep/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1447019433, "domain": "self.breastfeeding", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/3s1yc2/supply_suddenly_dropped/", "id": "3s1yc2", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/breastfeeding/comments/3s1yc2/supply_suddenly_dropped/", "retrieved_on": 1450675125, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hello Ladies! \n\n\nSo I'm here again for some advice and insight. \nA couple of days ago we finally manages to breastfeed without nipple shields. LO is mow 1month old and had to stay 2 weeks in NICU and it was impossible to get him to latch, so had to use the shields instead and I also pumped. \n\nBreastfeeding with the shields was never an issue and LO always ate a lot. So since we don't use the nippleshields anymore it seems that he is way more hungry and demands feeds more often. Where before at each feeding he only used one breast he now requires both and when pumping I noticed that I now only get half the amount out than I did before. \nUsually he uses one breast and I pump the other, always got around 120ml or more out from pumping the unused breast, but now I get barely 60ml out of the unused breast in the rare case He does not want the other breast as well. \n\nAnd almost after every feeding, a short time later he is so fussy and angry and hungry again, and my boobs just don't give anything anymore and I have barely any stash in the fridge as pumping does 't give as much anymore and we have to give him what we have left in bottles. \nWhere I had 4 bottles with each a whole meal in the fridge and had to actually throw the oldest out after a pump because I had no more bottles and freezerbags, I now have rarely anything more than 30-80ml in the fridge and it usually is just enough to satisfy his hunger. \n\nHe used to empty bottles with 160ml and now my boobs suddenly make much less than before. I know that pumping is not like LO sucking, but there is a huge difference now than how it was a week ago and he seems to be constantly hungry after feeding. I don't believe it is that cluster feeding I read about on here as he gets full, he does not want to lie there and suckle for hours, he wants to get full and then is out for hours. If he does not get enough from the boob he is unconsolable until he gets a bottle and gets full. \n\nI am getting worried that my boobs are not making enough anymore and I just can't keep up with how much he needs, and I of course also don't have enough pumped stash to top him off and I'm afraid I will have to supplement with formula at some point. \n\nIs there anything I can do about it, do you have any advice?

I have now managed to get an appointment with a private clinic/scan place for the 4th of June, so when I'm on week 23.\nThey will do a full abnormality scan and measure everything on the baby and have a very good look at all the organs that can be seen and check if everything is how/where it should be, and with a bit of luck we will also be able to finally learn if we are having a boy or a girl.\nIt costs us a lot extra to do that, but as our hospital apparently doesn't do these scans anymore, we don't really have any other choice if we want to know if that little worm is alright!\nLooking forward to see him/her again though and will update you guys on it too, if you're interested!\n\nSo about the question about the movements:\n\nAt middle/end of 19weeks I have sometimes felt a little nerve twitch down under my navel and then from 20weeks on it started happening more and more but it is usually at around the same place always.\nOn Monday the first time I felt it on another place as well and I noticed that these \"twitches\" always come when I eat/drink something cold (icecream or something) or when I eat fruits, or well..just eat in general.\n\n\nBy now I am fairly sure that it is our little Blobbie as it gets more and more over time, but still sometimes wondering why it happens while/after I eat something and if it maybe really just is a nerve twitching around...but then again, I NEVER felt this before every so it must be the little one?\nIt's also very unpredictable. There can be a twitch a couple of times in a row or just one for a while.. I press my hand at that spot to also feel it with my hand, and then there will of course not be anything anymore until I take the hand away again..\n\nSo, I guess I can assume that this definitely is the baby? I tend to be one of the \"glass is half empty\" people so I always think that things are not the \"good\" thing.. :)\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BabyBumps", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7cl", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Little Update to \"20w \"anatomy\" scan turned out to just measure if baby fits 20w.\" + Questions about movements!", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/36lray/little_update_to_20w_anatomy_scan_turned_out_to/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1431941236, "domain": "self.ireland", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/36coj3/consumer_rights_in_ireland_company_received/", "id": "36coj3", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ireland/comments/36coj3/consumer_rights_in_ireland_company_received/", "retrieved_on": 1440729558, "score": 7, "selftext": "Hello there, I crossposted that from legal advice to make sure. :)\n\nI'm hoping to get some legal advice here for the little issue I'm having.

You get an appointment and then spend hours over hours in the waiting room). \nAll the doctor did was taking 3 measurements (head, belly, thigh) and telling us that the measurement fits with the weeks I'm in, that's it. Then we had been sent our way again.\n\nI am extremely frustrated. As far as I could read here in this sub from a lot of you, around 20weeks-ish most of you got a proper scan checking for all kinds of things if everything is alright. I have not gotten anything.\nWe don't even know the gender of the little one either.\nThe machine they used could not see crap, we even had troubles seeing anything properly and the scan took 5 minutes at max.\n\nThe doctor said that he was struggling to measure anything because I am overweight. It seems though that we had seen even less now than we did on our 12weeks scan.\nI had been in a private clinic at 17weeks for a self-paid scan to just check up and we could see a lot, there weren't any problems seeing anything and the tech took a lot of measurements of what he could see and we just saw so many details like the ribs and the little ears and the little one hiccuping, yawning.. and there it was no problem with me being overweight and getting measurements.\n\nNow I tried to get an appointment with that clinic again to get an \"abnormality scan\" where they do a detailed scan of the baby's organs to detect any abnormalities and check measurements for head, brain, abdomen, legs (everything I thought a hospital will do around that time, but well, they didn't). Sadly, the clinic has no appointments free for the next months so I am again standing out in the dark with nothing.\n\nWe also never had the NT scan done because we just did not know anything about until it was too late. The hospital did not do it and just did a dating scan on 12weeks and did not give us any information or educate us about anything optional or what we could have done on our own, by private clinics or anything.\nI was hoping that doctors would educate us about everything pregnancy, tests that can be done, that should be done, that are not necessary, what can happen, but we get no information from anyone.\nI try to read as much as I can about everything but I can't spend 24/7 and read the whole internet, I hoped that professionals would help a little bit with it, but I guess that was just naive and stupid on my part.\n\nI am so frustrated and sad as I just want to know if the little one is healthy or if there is anything wrong and we were also hoping to finally find out if we are having a boy or a girl. I am extremely scared and stressed out and I have troubles feeling too excited about it yet because there is always the thought in the back of my head that something may still just go completely wrong and we end up not having a baby. \nI am too scared to buy any baby things and get my hopes up too high and then something happens and we won't need it anymore.\n\nIt already took us a long time to even get pregnant and we could not even manage without help from a fertility clinic and chances are that it may not gonna be easy to get pregnant again (either if something goes wrong or when we want a second child), and I'm utterly scared and feel like I'm just being left to \"fend for myself\" and deal with it. \n\nSorry for the whine. :/\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BabyBumps", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7cl", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "20w \"anatomy\" scan turned out to just measure if baby fits 20w.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/362805/20w_anatomy_scan_turned_out_to_just_measure_if/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": "GN", "author_flair_text": "29, #1 due 28.

I had my last appointment with the hospital in week 13 where I just got some basic information, went through my medical history and stuff and had a scan in week 12. At my appointment in week 13 I was told that I have to get to my GP in 4 weeks to get some bloodwork done (they just take blood, send it to the lab, lab sends it to the hospital) and 4 weeks after that I have my next appointment with the hospital. This.takes.soooooo.long.\n\nI would really know how the little one is doing, if everything is okay, if he/she is even still alive down there? I have no idea! I can't feel any movements yet (I read that some ladies felt it very early already, so now im jealous!), I'm also overweight which might make it a bit harder to feel? I also feel absolutely fine and have nothing to complain about other than being tired once in a while (luckily the first trimester exhaustion is gone, pheew, I was so done) and a bit more hungry than before. \nAlso, being overweight it's really hard to tell if I'm showing more or just getting fatter, booh.\nBut.. how do I tell? I really don't know!\n\n\nI'm trying to arrange a \"reassurance scan\" with some other clinic as the hospital does not offer that, but it keeps being a ping-pong game and I have not managed to get an appointment anywhere yet, which makes it a lot harder for me. My lovely SO is very helpful and keeps reminding me that everything is fine and we should not worry so much, but the wait is just horrible.\n\nI also read on a lot of posts here how much you ladies know about all your stuff, your hcg levels, your metas and betas (I don't even know what that is..), and I have not really gotten much information out of my appointments, and I honestly don't know what to ask for, but they usually seem very stressed and rushy.

I have no idea!\nI can't feel any movements yet (I read that some ladies felt it very early already, so now im jealous!), I'm also overweight which might make it a bit harder to feel?\nI also feel absolutely fine and have nothing to complain about other than being tired once in a while (luckily the first trimester exhaustion is gone, pheew, I was so done) and a bit more hungry than before. But.. how do I tell? I really don't know!\n\nI'm trying to arrange a \"reassurance scan\" with some other clinic as the hospital does not offer that, but it keeps being a ping-pong game and I have not managed to get an appointment anywhere yet, which makes it a lot harder for me.\nMy lovely SO is very helpful and keeps reminding me that everything is fine and we should not worry so much, but the wait is just horrible.\n\nI also read on a lot of posts here how much you ladies know about all your stuff, your hcg levels, your metas and betas (I don't even know what that is..), and I have not really gotten much information out of my appointments, and I honestly don't know what to ask for, but they usually seem very stressed and rushy.\nOn one of the clinics that offer scans they talk about \"nuchal fold\" or \"nuchal translucency\" checks and that this is done with a normal scan and when I read that, I realized that on my scan in the hospital nothing about this was mentioned nor done.

(http://www.reddit.com/r/CautiousBB/comments/2vbaqp/hai_i_will_be_a_frequent_visitor_here_too_now/)\nSo, we had been to our 12 week (exactly 12w0d!) ultrasound yesterday, and I could call it a disaster, well, not the scan but everything hospital-ish around it.\n\n\nA couple of weeks ago I got my letter from the hospital with my appointments. It listed that appointment for the 12week scan and then a week later another appointment. The letter clearly stated Ultrasound yesterday in floor 1 and the next appointment in floor 2. Easy!\n\n\nWe have never been there before so we went into the hospital and asked the reception where to go what to do and were directed to the ultrasound department.\nArrived there, no receptions or anything, just a waiting hall with chairs and a lot of people waiting, so we sat down and were waiting as well. I was already thinking if we maybe have to check in somewhere? But there are no receptions anywhere so I went with the thought \"Well, they told me that this is my appointment so I guess they expect me\". After waiting for over 1,5 hours (we had been told by friends that it takes AGES there!) someone finally came to us and asked us what we are waiting for. I tell her that we are here for the ultrasound and she then explained us that we have to check in at the reception.\nShe led us into a completely different department (Fetal assessment), through a side-door into a little corner in there where the nurses have a little desk.\n\n \nThey then proceed to tell me that we are wrong here and are supposed to go into the second floor, but unfortunately we are late (...) and they are not there anymore. This then was the point where I could not do anything anymore to hold back my tears as I was already scared and worried for some time before that scan and now theres a possibility that they don't do anything today and have to schedule a new appointment for me.\nLuckily they could fit us in down here anyways, yay. So a nurse (or doctor? I don't even know..) took us into an ultrasound room and we got to it.\nShe seemed very annoyed, cold and unfriendly. I did not feel very comfortable at all.  The ultrasound was very uncomfortable. The letter said I should have drank at least 1L water, and also read that should have a full bladder, and she just kept pressing very hard on my stomach and around the bladder, it was horrible.\nSadly the view was limited (I guess maybe because im overweight?) and she asked if I'm okay with an internal scan. She also mentioned that there is nothing that concerns her, she just would like to do an internal one to see more. Phew. No problemo then!\nSo she sent me to pee (thanks!!) and then we went ahead with the internal scan and we could see soooo much.\nThat little worm now looked like an actual tiny baby and less like an alien/worm like 4 weeks earlier! It was also moving around while we were looking at it, it was so amazing! We could also see the spine and ribs and the legs and arms and everything. \nIt was so great and amazing and made a lot of my worries, that something could be wrong, go away. Everything looked normal!\n\n\nShe then printed some pictures and very heartless ripped it out of the machine and handed it over without a word. The pictures have now folds in it because of how she ripped it out! Thanks for that, unfriendly person!\nI had internal scans before on 6w4d and 8w4d but never felt like I do now afterwards. It feels a bit uncomfortable down there now, I don't know what she did or if she was just not gentle moving the scanner around down there, but after the internal scans before I had in our fertility clinic, with very very lovely people!!, I never had any discomfort afterwards. It's nothing bad or severe, I sometimes felt that after having sex as well before I got pregnant, it feels like.. I can't even explain, a little like having a sore muscle from too much sport or something. \n\n\nI was so angry about that whole thing, no signs or information about anything how or where to even check in. There was nothing, there was no way we could have known anything as no one gave us that information that we have to go into a completely different department to check in at some nurses desk, but at least now we know for the next time.\nAfter seeing our little blob, it all felt less annoying. We are so happy now, but I will probably soon gonna start being worried again until the next scan. I am a bit uncomfortable with that hospital though. We have a consultation appointment next week and will see if the doctor there is nicer or if we have to go somewhere else in the future. It is very important for me to feel comfortable and not being treated half-arsed by the people there. I kinda need their encouragement and support to not be to worried myself to much.\n\nWell, now there we are. Having seen our little one, worries are less at the moment and I'm so happy. We were so happy yesterday that we decided to announce it now to others than only family and close friends. \nI'm sorry if the formatting is bad, I can't really figure it out. \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CautiousBB", "subreddit_id": "t5_30jcb", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "12w scan done yesterday!

We tried for around 1,5 years. I had been transferred to a fertility clinic and started a treatment with Clomid in december.\nOn Monday, January 5th I got an ovulation induction with pregnyl and was sent home to do some \"homework\" with my partner and we were told we can make a test at around 16 days after the day after the injections.\nThe test showed negative. Bought some more test and did some more the coming days and yay, 3 more tests showed positive!\nLast friday I had to get back to the clinic to make another internal ultrasound to check and we found a little sac and a heartbeat!\nThe nurse told us that it is nothing to worry about if we cannot see a heartbeat just yet, but she said that we can see one is very good.\nI have to come for another ultrasound to the clinic in 2 weeks.\n\nSo, seeing that little heartbeat on the ultrasound was so weird, and it makes it all so real suddenly and I almost cried when I saw it!\nWe try to be still very cautious as the first trimester is the one where it is still very risky. \nI am so happy, this means so much to us. But I am constantly worried I'm doing something wrong and mess it up, do something that harms the little Blop.\nYesterday I had some stomachaches and was so worried, but it was really just my stomach being annoyed because I ate too many fruits... \n\nI'm now also bit confused about the pregnancy week I'm i now.\nThe nurse said that on that day last Friday, I was 6 weeks and 4 days as they count from the day of the injection. I am fairly confused about that calculation though as I count only to 5weeks +1 day.\nI found a lot of resources about all things pregnancy on babycenter and they also had an App I obviously had to get. I put in the date of that Monday I got the injection and it also shows me that I'm on 7 weeks now (fitting to the nurses statement). \nI'm not sure if I'm missing something obvious here!?\nI'm sure I can clarify that next week on my scan but maybe someone here can enlighten me for now? :)\n\nI don't really have anyone else to talk about all this (other than my lovely partner of course), as we don't want to tell others just yet as it is still so early and anything could happen still. So I was hoping I can vent and hyper a little bit with you girls!\n\nMy post is probably also looks very poorly, I don't really understand how that stuff works here.. and, the post did not get a lot shorter than the original one I wanted to post.

I am suffering from acne since I had hit puberty, affected are the face, neck, chest, upper arms and shoulders.\nThe worst thing is my oily face. It is horrible, it is extreme, I feel like I am an organic oil factory, it is really really bad.\nI don't know anymore what to do with it.\nSo, a couple of years ago I had been to the doctor and it was mentioned that my acne is caused by the PCOS and to start with I received an acne cream. I can't remember the exact name anymore and I had used it for several months with no success at all. \nLater I had been put on birth control as this should clear the acne, I only got to take it 3 months (no change in that time either) until I had been referred to an endocrinologist and I had to stop taking the birth control to start treating my insulin resistance caused by PCOS, I am currently taking 1700mg of metformin daily to tackle this.\nAs me and my SO are trying for a baby, going back on birth control is not an option, it is hard enough to conceive when suffering from PCOS so postponing it is not something I want to do.\nSo, over the time my skin got more and more oily and it is now at a point where I wash my face and not even half an hour later I can already see the oil pouring out of my pores, and only a short amount of time later my skin feels like an oilfield.\nI have spent some time in the interwebz trying to find something about it, I have found many things to try out and I tried them: washing with vinegar, making a mayo mask, yeast masks, creams with benzoyl peroxide, washing things with salicylic acid, witch hazel and tea tree stuff etc. etc.\nNothing I have tried helped and it just slowly gets worse and worse. \nI try to use as little washing things and cream things as possible as I thought that it might just irritate my skin even more if I keep putting stuff on it, I also very very rarely use makeup.\nI had used moisturising creams after washing my face but it only seemed to oil even more when doing that.\nI also read that mineral makeup can help with this so I ordered some bare minerals makeup but that did not do anything either, my skin just oils it all away and as soon as I touch my face I have oily makeup on my fingers.\nI have found a product called T-Zone from Dermadoctor which should matte the skin and absorbing the oil without drying it out and I use this one in the morning before I leave the house. It does feel good to have it on but I seriously can't see any difference. As soon as arrive at work, my skin is completely oily again. During the day I only wash my face with water as I don't bring cleaning products to work.\n\nMy endocrinologist is not very helpful with that either and does not come up with any ideas about it, and the other doctor says that  it may only work by using birth control.\nI'm very much at my ends now as I feel very very uncomfortable with it. It feels absolutely horrible when my face is so oily, I love how it feels right after washing it, so fresh and clean and I want it to always be like that.\n\nCurrently I'm some of Boots Tea Tree and Witch Hazel Products, mostly a foaming face wash and the a body scrub (no improvements anywhere) and Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit face wash, that only thing that helps with is somewhat with the blackheads on the nose, but thats about it.\nI gave it up with moisturisers as it just makes my skin oil even more, it feels like my skin is going all 'ohmygod what are you putting on me, get it off get it oooffff' and tries to oil it away.\n\nI think at that point now I really need some miracle stuff. Do you guys have any tips or tricks for me? I would really appreciate it. I am also living in Ireland so I might not have access to most of the stuff you guys get in the great USA.\n\n\nThanks in advance and sorry for the wall o' text!\n\nTL;DR: I'm a human oil factory and I soon can start to sell organic human oil.

So, we sorted it all out with my endocrinologist not long after I made this last post. I had not heard from her because they did not save my new address into their file and sent me prescriptions to my old address, thats sorted now though.\n\nAll the bloodwork was as she expected and she put me on metformin. I had to take 500mg once daily for 2 weeks, then 500mg twice daily for 4 weeks and from then I am taking 850mg twice daily, I started the 3rd month with that dose just a week ago. My first period I got after the first 2 weeks of 500mg I think and since then...nothing! I planned to call my doctor on sunday as I was also feeling very moody and sad and then..BAM..period. And it is a pain. My doctor asked me to come back to her around the 3rd month of the 850mg daily (which is around now) for a checkup and how I am going on. I don't know, I'm just not getting anywhere. I feel no change since I am on metformin, except that I got a period now.. after months. And who knows if it even continues.\n\nI have not lost any weight since I'm on metformin, and I have tried things. I tried the gym, but I really can't motivate myself enough for it. I am working in a callcenter on the phone and doing this all day, I then just want to get home and have quiet time for me and my lovely SO. I don't want to jump around in a gym for another hour and then need an additional hour to get home from work. Once I'm home, I will have to go straight to bed so I can have a bit of sleep before it goes to work again. I have a very healthy diet but that does not change anything either. I am not loosing any weight, no matter what I am doing. I tried keto, but I don't have time to cook things and I can't stand bacon and eggs, so there are not a lot of alternatives. A few times already I gave it a try with a complete meal replacement diet, so shakes all the way. I can't keep that up completely either. At the moment I have 1-2 shakes during the whole day (1 shake would be approx. 160 calories I think) and in the evening I have a healthy dinner with my SO. I am only drinking water, and sometimes a little diet coke in between. Does this change anything? Nope. I don't know what to do about it anymore. I think a full meal replacement would help (i did it for 1 week but gave up then because I was feeling miserable) and in that week I lost 2 kilos, wohhooo, but I am not sure I can do that longer than that. I don't know how to do it all, I don't know how to motivate myself. My SO would love to help me, but we have different jobs and we have no weekends together either, so we try to enjoy the 2-3 hours in the evenings we have together.\n\nAnother big problem is my skin. The docs told me that I have a mild acne which is caused by the whole PCOS thing and I had prescribed creams for it but it did not help anything, I have used them over a couple of months. I have spots and stuff in my face, shoulders, upper arms and chest and I have that since I was 15 or something and I can't seem to get rid of it. My face is a whole oilfield. The skin is producing and producing and producing without any end, seriously. I wash my face either with only water or very mild cleaning products, I don't use any makeup and it just keeps going. I feel like I can start selling my own organic cooking oil. I was my face in the morning and not even half an hour later I have already an oilfilm everywhere in my face. It is disgusting and annoying. I can feel it all day and I just can't take it anymore. I am going to the bathroom several times a day to rinse my face with water so I don't look like I was just polished with wax. Is there anyone who has any suggestions what I can do about this? The doctors could not be of any other help other than the prescribed cream, when I told them that it isn't working, they did not have any alternatives.\n\nAnother issue is also the hair growth, it also seemed to gotten worse since I am on metformin, especially at the lower and upper arms, stomach and upper and lower legs. I feel so uncomfortable with myself, I rarely want to go out as I feel ugly. I don't feel like a woman anymore. I want to go swimming or wear summerly light clothes (as it is crazy hot here) but I don't because I feel fat (well I don't just feel like it, I am) and the acne and hair on my arms, shoulder, chest, stomach..I don't want people to see it and feel like people notice these things even if I cover it.\n\nI am at the end and I am scared of my next visit at my endocrinologist as this woman did not seem to care at all really, or it might just be me thinking that people are secretly judging and laughing about me. There are sadly no alternatives available where I live. I often feel very sad and depressed and unhappy with everything and don't really know how to get out of this whole mess. My SO though is an angel. He is supportive as much as he can and he does not care about all the things that make me feel ugly and helps getting my mood up all the time, but...I still want them to change but don't know how to go about it and how to keep myself motivated and not giving up.\n\nWe also would like to have a baby soon, and I really want this, and it makes me even sadder to know that I am not really able to if my ovaries are not working as they should and it regularly depresses me alot, where I often sit at home and just cry around for a while. I also want to be in a better shape before getting pregnant (if that is even possible for me..)..\n\nSo.. I don't know. I don't want to have to deal with this anymore and I think I don't have enough willpower to go 7 days a week to the gym and completely throw away the couple of hours I can be with my SO and I can have for myself to relax. I feel like a failure and I feel like I'm broken as everything about me is not normal. I want to be normal like all the other people too. I want to be able to eat and drink things normally without putting on weight from it, as this I don't seem to be able to. I want to have a normal look and normal skin and not being afraid of showing skin. I want to be able to have kids and not having to take prescriptions and go through whatever-else may come to me because it may not work naturally. Why does this happen to me?\n\nNow reading all I wrote afterwards, I'm sorry for this huge pile of whine. If you have any tips for me I would really appreciate it.\n\n**TL;DR:** Being on Metformin since March/April, only got period twice, no health loss reached yet without going on complete food replacement diets and also babywish. Motivation pretty much gone and not sure what to do anymore, it starts to be really depressing. Symptoms like skin and hair make me feel ugly and I just don't want this PCOS crap anymore.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PCOS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryc6", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "I don't want to have to deal with it anymore. it's depressing.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1i52is/i_dont_want_to_have_to_deal_with_it_anymore_its/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1373455798, "domain": "self.AskReddit", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1i020b/what_is_the_nicest_thing_a_customer_has_ever/", "id": "1i020b", "is_self": true, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1i020b/what_is_the_nicest_thing_a_customer_has_ever/", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1412070680, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What is the nicest thing a customer has ever said/done to/for you that totally made your day?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1i020b/what_is_the_nicest_thing_a_customer_has_ever/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1362405455, "domain": "self.PCOS", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/19mym0/still_waiting_for_enddiagnose_frustrating/", "id": "19mym0", "is_self": true, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/PCOS/comments/19mym0/still_waiting_for_enddiagnose_frustrating/", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1413015464, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hey Ladies!\n\nI have posted here a bit more than a year ago, I was at my GP and he mentioned that I might have PCOS due to my symptoms and sent me to a specialist.\nI had to wait 6 months for an appointment at the specialist and then was told I have to get several blood tests done before she can diagnose me 100% and prescribe a treatment (metmorfin is on the table).\nSo, I had these bloodtests done, which took a couple of months and a bit later I got a letter (yes, a letter, she does never call, she sends letters by post) telling me I need to get more bloods done.\nSo done that again and waited a couple of months. Then I get another letter saying we need another blood test. Gah!\n\nEvery damn one of these bloodtests had to be done between the 3rd and 5th day of my period, but due to (possible) PCOS I do not have a period at all. So every time I had to contact her again telling her I cannot get them done without a prescription for provera pills, to force my body to it.\nSo, last bloods were taken almost 2 months ago now, and I am still waiting to get any info or results or prescription.\nIt gets really frustrating now, it's been over a year now that I was told that this might be what causes all my problems, and I still have not gotten any help and all my symptoms seem to get worse and worse.\nI keep calling her (can never talk to her directly, I always have to leave a voicemail) but seriously, this all is taking ages.\nIt is really frustrating when I read here that people went to their docs and flup, got their prescription for metmorfin already to tackle those silly symptoms.\nIn the meantime I have changed my diet completely, I made a lot of exercise, I tried keto, but nothing really works with my weight and I just keep gaining. It is frustrating and devastating and I wonder how long I will still have to wait until I get some help/treatment.\n\nAnyone here has experienced the same with having to do several blood tests (I think it was around 5 or 6 now), waiting very long for each?  \nAny tips for losing some weight even if exercise and healthy diet does not work?\nI'm really at the end with my ideas by now.\n\n*Edit: I accidentally a word.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PCOS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ryc6", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Still waiting for end-diagnose, frustrating!", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/19mym0/still_waiting_for_enddiagnose_frustrating/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1341146578, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/vvl2z/say_hai_to_sooty/", "id": "vvl2z", "is_self": false, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/aww/comments/vvl2z/say_hai_to_sooty/", "score": 1, "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o", "thumbnail": "http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xRsJOwsDgyPvWSCa.jpg", "title": "Say HAI to Sooty!", "url": "http://imgur.com/XOImb"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1338256212, "domain": "self.keto", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/u9mfg/looking_for_lowcarb_bread_spreads_co_in_irelanduk/", "id": "u9mfg", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/keto/comments/u9mfg/looking_for_lowcarb_bread_spreads_co_in_irelanduk/", "score": 6, "selftext": "So, i'm on my 6th day with keto now and yesterday I reaaally wanted some bread.

My goal is to go down to around 60-60 kilos (~140lbs).\n\nI was always overweight since puberty. I never paid a lot of attention to it until it was too late.\nAround a year ago (starting with 95kilos) I started making changes in my diet like only using lowfat products,\navoid a lot of fat and sugar, eating more veggis, cook healthier etc. and it actually helped a bit, I lost around\n5 kilos after a month. I was superhappy but then suddenly it was all back again. :(\nI of course kept all the diet changes I made and last october I went to the doctor to have a look whats going\non. My doctor saidI might have PCOS and made some bloodtests and said I should go to the gym 7 times a\nweek and not eating all day long (I was a bit shocked after that statement >.<). However, I managed to\nget to the gym 3-4 times a week for an hour and it took me 3 months to lose 2 kilos. This was very frustrating.\nMy bloodtests came back sometimes in those 3 months and I got told that I have to get an appointment with \na specialist (Endorcrinologist). I waited 6 long months to finally get an appointment and I had been diagnosed \nwith PCOS a few weeks ago, and this is very likely what makes it so hard for me to loose weight.\nI have not gotten any medication yet, I'm still waiting for (more...) bloodtests to be made and in around \n1 or 2 months i can expect to get my metmorfin, which will hopefully help me a bit.\n\nI was reading a lot about different diets and very often I heard keto. Also just when reading around here on \nreddit it was mentioned very often, so I thought I'd have a look and yesterday decided to give it a try!\nIt was a lot of information to go through and I hope I'll do everything right, but i stumbled across a problem!\n\nBreakfast!\n\nUsually I'm not really a breakfast eater but I guess I have to, and my doctor said I should take at least 3 meals\na day to keep my metabolism working. All breakfast recipes I can find that are keto-friendly are fried things like scrambled eggs, bacon and stuff like that. I can't stand that. :(\nI cannot eat fried things in the morning, it makes me nauseous, and I'm also a very lazy and grumpy morning \nperson, so me standing in the kitchen frying stuff...noo. (And I don't like bacon!)\n\nI had a very hard time finding something breakfastish, the only thing I could find is this and I ate it this morning (I'm still sooo full!):\nhttp://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/breakfast1/r/flaxpdcereal.htm\nI'm not sure I can eat that every day, it has a very weird consistence and tastes a bit odd. ;)\n\nSoooo, I was wondering if you guys and gals have some ideas for yummy breakfast you could share with me?\nI'd also appreciate all tips you can give me to keto. \nDo you have any (easy?) special favorite recipes (not only breakfast) you could recommend? \n\n\nThank you all in advance! :)\n\n", "subreddit": "keto", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rske", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My first day!", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/tyyck/my_first_day/"}, {"author": "Sahri", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1324139608, "domain": "self.TwoXChromosomes", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ngf8s/oh_noes_pcos/", "id": "ngf8s", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ngf8s/oh_noes_pcos/", "score": 3, "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI was always a bit overweight since puberty and i always tried to change my diet, do some exercise etc. but i often just gave up after a while because i never really saw any results.\nHowever, a few months ago i weight myself and i decided i have to do something. I was at around 95 kilos (1,69m tall or so) and i said to myself 'Well, thats enough. If you don't do anything you'll go over 100. We don't want that!'\nSaid that, done that. I changed my whole diet, using as little fat as possible, avoid all kinds of sugar and unhealthy food.\nI started cooking myself instead of buying easy stuff, gave up sodas (i used to drink coke, then i changed to diet coke, and then i changed to water). No sweets, no pastries etc. \nI was a very good girl with that stuff, and i got rewarded. In around 3 weeks i lost 5 kilos, i was happy that it goes so well.\nI continued with what i did and then...poing... 3 kilos up again and they did not go down anymore. Frustrated.\n\nAround 2 months back i went to my doctor because of my weight and nothing really seems to work. I also started going to the gym once a week for an hour.\nMy doctor said that i might have PCOS due to other symptoms i have like very irregular period, acne etc. and she took some blood which got sent to the lab.\nYesterday i had to come back to the doc to talk about the results and he said that he is very certain that i have PCOS, they took some more bloodsamples, gave me a diet plan and he will send me to an specialist. \nHe is a very nice doc and he said he does not want to put me on any meds until they are really sure that i have that, now i just wait until i get an appointment with the specialist. (Gah, i hate waiting, i am very impatient).\n\nI think the most annoying thing is my skin. I annoying spots, blackheads and a veeeeery oily skin in my face. Around 15-20 minutes after cleaning my face my skin starts to produce oil and puts it all over my face. My face is so shiny and oily, it is sooo uncomfortable. I really hate it, and i can't find anything that helps it.\nFrom my doc i got some acne cream (Differin) which should help with the acne and i use it since 1,5 months but no changes. It seems it helps a bit against the blackheads but the rest is still the same and the oiling gets even worse.\nI have tried all kinds of stuff, teatree-witchhazel cleaning products and creams, clearsil, teatree oil. I tried non chemical housemade magical wonder things like honey masks, vinegarwater. No luck. :(\nI found a cream from 'dermadoctor' which is an oil controle gel. You just put that on and it removes oil and keeps it oilfree. This gel helps for around 1-2 hours now, then my skin gets all oily again. :/\nI have asked my doc yesterday if he has anything else and he considered putting me on birthcontrol pills but due to my weight, the fact that i'm a smoker and the history of several strokes my dad had (he is fine now again luckily) he does not want to risk anything until i had been with the specialist.\n\nI was hoping, when posting here, that anyone of you girls have any suggestions for me about my skin or weightloss until i finally get to the specialist and medication. I'm getting very desperate, i don't want to be overweight anymore, my self estime is very low because of all this. I have a loving boyfriend who does not care that i'm overweight and he does not care if i can't lose weight, this makes me very happy, but i stil want to do something about all that.\n\nI'm also going to the gym since 1,5 months around 3-4 times a week for an hour, changed my diet a bit more so i don't consume more than around 1400 calories, i keep it free of fat, sugar and whatdoiknow what else. I'm trying very hard. In the last 1,5 months with all the gym, all the eat less and healthy i lost _only_ 2,5 kilos. It is very frustrating to not see better results.\n\nI'm sorry if that wall of text is written too confusing, i'm still a bit meh about the visit at the doc and the very high chance of having PCOS.\n", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Oh noes, PCOS?
