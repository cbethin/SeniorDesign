It would have done me a lot of good.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the ripe old age of 22.  But I had the symptoms of it long before that and it stunted my growth as a human.\n\nI was a military brat, and since I moved around every two or three years all my life, i was constantly the new kid, which meant getting constantly picked on or bullied.  By the time I would get settled and have a small network of buddies for a couple months, it was time to pack up again.  Being a military brat really sucked.\n\nThis, along with my mother's extreme religious doctrine that myself and my siblings had to follow, made me a punching bag at public schools, and I would get stomach aches just walking to the bus stop.  I wasn't allowed to do all the fun things other kids were doing, I couldn't even have a girlfriend, and then again no kids wanted me around because I was \"weird\".  \n\nSo when I was 17, I enlisted in the Air Force.  Going to college just sounded like 4 more years of high school.  I did well at basic training and my job school, but my mental health, which had been waning since I was a kid, starting kicking in full throttle.  I started having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts.  My commander sent me to get evaluated after I started freaking out at SERE school, and they told my I was going home.  They gave me an honorable discharge, and told me have a nice life.\n\nThis was the first and only time I ever felt like I was liked by other people.  I honestly felt like I belonged.  But it was taken away.  So I moved back home and got a job.  \n\nMy parents became more sympathetic after I came home, and sent me to a therapist.  I had, and still have, trouble connecting with people, because my mood goes in extremes, crazy hypomania, and extreme, suicidal depression.  \n\nI moved out of my folks place at 19 and got an apartment.  I was able to get set up at the VA.  But it got worse over time, and I attempted suicide.  I have never felt so lonely.  Even though I can carry on conversation just fine, that black cloud over me head is visible to others, and I push people away.  I wish it wasn't so hard to do things that other people do with ease.  \n\nAfter years of absolute hell, I finally am going to intensive group therapy and pills that actually work..  I really have terrible issues forming relationships, shit, I've never had a girlfriend.  \n\nI wish I had done all this shit when I was 16, because I needed it then.  But now I'm 22 and am behind 8 years developmentally.  \n\nIf you are a teenager/young person and feel outcast, alone, or feel out of touch with the world, tell someone.    Go to a counselor, a trusted friend, or a teacher.  Make sure to get help early as preventative medicine so you don't end up with a belt around your neck like I did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "offmychest", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "subreddit_subscribers": 742274, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bipolar II is ruining my life", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9x2eaq/bipolar_ii_is_ruining_my_life/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "jes6991", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_202gadxz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541953185, "domain": "self.sex", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9w50k4/bipolar_disorder_type_ii_and_lack_of_sexual/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9w50k4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/sex/comments/9w50k4/bipolar_disorder_type_ii_and_lack_of_sexual/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1541953186, "score": 1, "selftext": "Why i'm a 22 year old virgin male is quite a combination of things.
