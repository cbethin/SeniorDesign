But I didn't do everything I wanted like to go a birthday party I was invited to and in the summer I had nothing to do because I didn't get to do anything with any of my non close friends who were off to uni and my college friends who were doing their own things. I became depressed because I had no friends and became suicidal because everyone around me was growing up (Im 18) and I had no one to do anything with. It got to a point where I was advised to pull out of College for a year; so I have to do the final year of the course with different people. It doesn't help that I was diagnosed as autistic (I have Aspergers, which is a mild form of Autism) which will make it harder to make friends. \n\nBut the huge , main problem here is my family and how they treat and react to negative issues. They argue every possible logical outcome like its no big deal and they have no /low standards for me. They don't realise that if they treated me like a teenager and not like an adult when I was 13/14,  even if I was more ignorant about how the world works I would find life less overwhelming and could focus better on studies and socialising. This year I got really good grades and could've literally gotten a part time or even a full time job at a supermarket which would be better than the four hour job I currently have and then I could have saved up enough money over the past few months to live a more independent, more social life. Loads of people from College made plans but I couldn't go because I'm too poor and I was so done with everything by the end of the year I just gave up since they all didn't like me much anyway. My family literally don't care that I could of had a more socially acceptable, normal life and only get annoyed if I do things that inconvenience them. From the beginning of the year, even when I was so happy, and they knew that I had free time for the first time in school (since year 10 work would take up all of my time probably due to autism), and yet they still didn't care what I did or do, just as long as I'm out of their hair and I'm \"independent\". I could and would of been so much happier if either the people my age or my family were actual friends to me as opposed to parental guardians or collegues. \n\nThe frustrating thing is I know that logically it makes sense I am where I am; I didn't have any / many friends before College anyway (and none of them are close to me) and I still didn't have a job (or anything in my life) until my siblings literally dragged me to the high street to give out my CVs.  I had no friends so I would be depressed and constantly be really sad and miserable. But if I would've just had friends/ forms of social support in my life I could've just lived a normal life and I would've been motivated to enjoy life and work hard. This happened at 16 when I went on a summer camp called the National Citizenship Service but it only lasted three weeks. I met loads of people in my area and became really good friends with a couple, but obviously in the real world this just meant I met them for a Coffee every once in a while; I still don't have a single friend who I can call at anytime or always rely on e.t.c. Once I go home from meeting the very few friends I have my life goes back to being boring and underwhelming. I talk to myself A LOT and watch loads of youtube videos. \n\nI am aware that this is a sitiation loads of people can find themselves in, but what's frustrating to me is I COULD of had a normal life if I was diagnosed with autism earlier (I only found out last year) and my family had done more to make sure I was being friends with people my age and was doing more than just spending hours on my laptop. But my parents gave up on discipline and on treating me like a 12 year old child seeing the world for the first time and just let me do whatever.. and without any friends throughout my teenage life I don't feel motivated to do anything myself anymore and I'm so done with it all. I have gone through all the phrases; self harm, depression, mental breakdowns, denial, sadness, anger, dissapointment and even just trying to laugh at things that aren't even funny (e.g. I am 18, I have no friends, everyone else I grew up around is doing better than me because they have SOMETHING they can look forward to) because I'm just in disbelief in how ridiculous this situation is. I find it crazy how, when I do talk to the couple of friends I know from university, who would probably ignore me if they knew what was really going on, I have to pretend I'm not in any of this mess. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like there is no tangible way to express my sadness, knowing that if I got a better job and stayed in College, I probably would of had the confidence to get help for my Aspergers, maintain friendships (even if they aren't strong) and still do school work. I enjoyed my course as well as the people on that course even if their friendship didn't mean the same to them as it did to me. \n\nWhat's weirder is I feel like if I wasn't just sat at home (now I only work four hours and am not in full time education, but am looking for full time jobs) I would have a different opinion on all of this; like on NCS when I was 16 and I became confident enough to make those friends and magically everything in my life clicked into place because I thought I had finally gotten friends that were really close to me. I became motivated even if I was still disadvantaged by the lack of anything from my parents. I obviously love them, and I have three older siblings who have done well for themselves, but they all had really close groups of genuine friends by my age and are a lot more intelligent than I am. I'm also guessing not being on the Autism spectrum makes maintaining friendships easier. I also had really bad anxiety throughout the year and was convinced  I had Haemorrhoids; I've also been leaking blood from my bum e.t.c but the doctor can't find anything abnormal when he examines the area and the therapists said it could literally be the anxiety physically manifesting itself in my body. They said the gut and the brain are connected and this can happen. \n\nI  know this is long and it does come across as being ridiculous but this is the situation I'm in, I have no idea what to do and I literally so done knowing I couldn've had a normal life had I been allowed to stay and I was raised better and I was diagnosed earlier. I have been in a ridiculous, weird, dark headspace for a really long time and would appreciate some advice.\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "family", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmf5", "subreddit_subscribers": 5332, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I am so over my family", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/9pxax9/i_am_so_over_my_family/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "Crispy_taco09", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_21zzrqwl", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539307796, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9nfzwf/im_done/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9nfzwf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9nfzwf/im_done/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539307797, "score": 1, "selftext": "There is NOTHING going for me in life.

I have very few friends and go to college where people are friendly but not close friends . I have been in a weird mindset lately because I\u2019ve lived with my mum and dad . It started out really great but then they stopped talking to me . We stopped making good conversation and they started complaining like stereotypical old people . At one point my dad didn\u2019t put up a canvas picture and my mum said they should see other people . A ridiculous and hilarious situation . \n\nAlso I realised that while everyone else was making money and spending time with friends I was still only working four hours a week which was nothing in comparison to the 20 hours a week I would\u2019ve or could\u2019ve worked . No one seems to care that I could of been so much more financially independent . \n\nI have been in a ridiculous situation . Whenever I was with my family we did boring slow paced activities that my parents wanted to do such as take long walks . As a young 18 year old it would have been better if I did more lively things . But obviously I don\u2019t have the friends for that . \n\nI have had a three month summer holiday but all I could focus on was my painful haemorrhoids which cause anal bleeding and pain and itchiness and burning sensations just because . \ud83d\ude11 Good news is they\u2019re not severe or life threatening just really painful \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43. \n\n\nI am aware I\u2019m in a ridiculous situation wherein I didn\u2019t do any normal teenager / young adult things apart from study and get decent ish grades . But everyone got those grades and got jobs and / started driving and /or entered relationships etc . Also I\u2019m autistic and apparently this can make it harder to form relationships . \n\nOverall I\u2019m so done with life , or the lack there of that I\u2019ve been experiencing . I feel betrayed and as an 18 year old adult feel the right that as someone who experiences on and off anal pain ( which the doctor basically said was more so a result of stress than a physical problem when I got them checked when I was 16) and feel like I have a right to die . I either want an amazing life or no life at all . I refuse to be the subject of shitty circumstances or pity or sadness . My family have sat back and let me be a social recluse for three months even though they said I was depressed . All my mum ever does it chat shit about all the racist shit and all the horrific surgeries she\u2019s had growing up in Kenya and India . She is so fucking depressed I get it from her . \n\nEveryone else is in this amazing headspace because they are financially independent and have friends and have spent the three month summer holiday having fun which they have shown on snapchat . But obviously they don\u2019t care about me and wouldn\u2019t help if I told them the situation . Furthermore in our first year of college we had very little work . I still didn\u2019t apply for a job or anything even though most of my first year was free time . I think I was depressed before or something maybe . \n\n\n\nI feel sad I could\u2019ve spent the summer building muscle and not just binging on junk food . I violated my vegan principles by binging on non vegan junk food in my room. I have gained weight and my parents just say or do nothing . Even before I was 18. And my college friends aren\u2019t close enough to me even though we literally did so much to help each other . When one of their sisters were dying we all stopped studying and talked with her . She also has a girlfriend who she met at the beginning of the year . They spent everyday of their lives together for like5 months straight . She knows her family and vice versa . They have become so close and their lives have become so intertwined it\u2019s frustrating to see a relationship flourish in front of you while some days you can\u2019t even walk properly because of the haemorrhoid pain and because you barely have any friends . \n\n\nIt\u2019s funny because I could\u2019ve had a better experience but I strongly believe my family\u2019s lack of help or guidance , predisposed genes to feel depressed , a juxtaposition between my experience and other people\u2019s experiences etc has made me so done. I don\u2019t even have a self esteem anymore. I don\u2019t even go to college anymore .  I don\u2019t want to live half the life I could\u2019ve led if I did work out and looked better , or if I got a job earlier and had more money . \n\n\nEven if I continue to live life it\u2019ll be a socially undesirable life because I\u2019m a little chubby and live with my parents . Everyone even now comments on the way I look and the situation I\u2019m in . A lot of my relatives I feel belittle me and my parents definitely don\u2019t take my situation seriously . Other families actually work together but my family is so individually focused . Even on Christmas we just do our own things . I just don\u2019t want to live the life I would live if I do work hard and don\u2019t give up. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "subreddit_subscribers": 101326, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Over it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9fl07z/over_it/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "Crispy_taco09", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535416557, "domain": "self.hemorrhoid", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/9aucsu/toothpaste/", "id": "9aucsu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/hemorrhoid/comments/9aucsu/toothpaste/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1535416559, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sometimes it feels more comfortable if I use my fingers to remove left over faecal matter after I\u2019ve defecated.

The problem is I got checked two years ago and they said it was normal . \n\nI\u2019ve also been so lonely I haven\u2019t been able to do much for myself like apply for a better job or enjoy my summer like a normal 18 year old. I see posts of everyone having fun , drinking , partying etc with their school friends (not college friends) and now I only have two weeks left of summer and I haven\u2019t done much because I\u2019ve been in such a weird headspace. There\u2019s no way my parents would give me money to do these things so I would have to get a job. But so much of the time I experience pain or am really awkward or can\u2019t really think straight when trying to apply for a job . I\u2019m considering taking a year to try and get surgery and recover and save up some money and then pay for college myself when I go back ? Does anyone have any other ideas / advice ?
