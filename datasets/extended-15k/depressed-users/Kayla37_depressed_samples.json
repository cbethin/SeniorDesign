I spiraled out of control, and I knew it was more than just depression. I understood why she needed her space, but at the same time, it wasn't me that was acting in that manner. I know you guys understand, it's like something takes over you and you can't control it. Amy knew about my struggles before the trip, and I even explained to her that when I get like that, I can't control it. However, I understood her reasoning and respected it. Another girl, let's call her Jenn, was on the trip as well. We weren't as close, but she saw everything and didn't reach out to me either when we got back. She has yet to, months later. I sent her an apology text and that I got the help I needed, but no response.\n\nTwo days after coming home, I got to a point where I felt like everyone was against me, and no one would literally talk to me. I was so mad that others weren't talking to me for something that was out of my control. I had a very very low evening two days after the trip.... I kept thinking it is my fault for why I'm at this state, why I ruined their vacation, it's not an excuse, etc. etc.\n\nIn an attempt to try and save my life, I texted an old friend that I hadn't seen in over year. Our friendship ended on a bad note, but she was my last hope. I remember thinking if she didn't respond, this is it. She did. She came over, took me to the hospital where I admitted myself, and she took care of everything back home for me. She called me every day. Let's call her, Sara. \n\nAmy called me at the hospital one time. Amy was actually my best friend out of anyone. I told her more than my own family. However, I had to remind myself that we all deal with things differently, and it's not all about me.\n\nAfter coming home, I felt negative feelings towards Amy. I just kept thinking about those 2 days after the trip, and how her mom said she needed space, but she was the one person I could always trust and who understood that those instances weren't me. It's hard because I feel like we were both in the right in our feelings. She needed her space, but I needed her more than anything.\n\nShe reached out to me and tried connecting again the weeks following. I told her that I had no ill will towards her, but that I now needed time to heal, we both did. \n\nI saw her a month later, told her the whole story about the hospital and reconnecting with Sara. Amy doesn't like Sara, but I was hoping that would open her eyes a bit to the type of person Sara is. The three of us used to be a trio.\n\nAs soon as I said that I've reconnected with her, she immediately switched her demeanor. She hasn't talked to me since. She then deleted me and Sara off Facebook.\n\nNo idea what I did... What Sara did...\n\nI thought about trying to salvage it again, but is it worth it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "bipolar", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnv4", "subreddit_subscribers": 54160, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Lost a friend during a bad episode; ever happen to you?
