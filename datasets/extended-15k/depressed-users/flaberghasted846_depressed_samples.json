I am pretty sure I have severe social anxiety because all the time I am thinking of how he wants to leave me and never talk to me again. Or that he wants to find new friends. And if he\u2019s gone I have no friends whatsoever. I always ask him to hang out but he never asks me. He\u2019s invited to parties and to hang out all the time but he never invites me. I feel like he is my friend but I am not his.\n\n3. I can\u2019t get a girl at all. I am a junior in high school. So I know to a lot of you this seems really dumb and stupid of me to think I need a girl right now but EVERYONE around me has a girlfriend/boyfriend. Homecoming just passed so you know I just saw 50 thousand posts about the dance and that makes me feel pathetic. And as much as I want a girl I\u2019m not physically/mentally attracted to anyone. Every time I try to talk to a girl I get very uncomfortable and don\u2019t know what to say at all. \n\n4. I am fat. Now I\u2019m not obese but I feel very fat. I starved myself over this past week and lost 15 pounds but I\u2019m putting them back on. Why would any girl be attracted to me if I wouldn\u2019t be. Most people would say I\u2019m slim-ish (I\u2019m 155 lbs now) but I still feel like garbage.\n\n5. I can\u2019t stop thinking about how I want to die. I\u2019ve researched for hours on how to kill myself and I know the way I want to go. I\u2019m not going to say because I don\u2019t want to get reported and have my parents get a phone call saying that their son posted about the way he is gonna kill himself in the middle of the night. But I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. \n\n6I have an appointment for \u201canxiety\u201d tomorrow and I really don\u2019t want to go. I want to talk to the dude about how I think I have depression but I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll just say \u201chere is medication, see ya in 4 weeks\u201d and that will make me feel so goddamn worthless. I can\u2019t tell my parents about my sadness because they would just annoy the shit out of me if they knew. \n\n7. I am ready to go. I don\u2019t feel anything anymore. When I do I feel something I feel complete despair and sadness. Otherwise I feel absolutely nothing. I want to die. If you read this far congratulations. You read my entire shitty life. Reply plz. Just want to talk with anyone.
