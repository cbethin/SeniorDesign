Needless to say, I used to\"fake\" it in therapy. I would say what I knew the therapist wanted to hear and before I know it, he said I was \"better\" and didn't need therapy anymore. Almost 10 years later, my depression has not subsided at all.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was in a very dark place mentally. At the time, my relationship with my boyfriend wasn't good, we argued a lot. It didn't help that I was taking really challenging engineering courses in school and I wasn't seeing the grades I was working so hard to get. I felt like a terrible girlfriend, daughter, sister, friend, student, etc. \n\nI came home one day after school, no one was home, and sat on the bathroom floor with the door left ajar. I cried as I tightly held a belt and tied it into noose. I was determined to do. There was a moment of pure silence. As I sat there emptily staring at the bathroom wall and into the void of my mind, my cat pushed the door open and poked his head in. He stared at me and made a soft sound. I cried even harder and dropped the belt. He ran into the living-room. \n\nTo this day, I feel like he's the sole reason I'm alive. He stopped me. I am not entirely sure the word \"save\" is accurate even though it's in the title. I say this because suicidal thoughts still fill my mind from time to time. I am not healed. I am not \"better\". I've never told anyone about this incident.\n\nI stand by the belief that pets are very helpful for people struggling with mental illness. My cat never fails to put a smile on my face regardless of whatever else is happening around me. He fills the void in my mind. I have been thinking of seeking professional help again and actually participate in it because ever since I had the therapist at age 13, I've felt that if I was able to fool him, how would anyone help me?\n\nI am not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this post but if it is, I hope it helps someone out there.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 400586, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "My cat saved me once", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9sphvu/my_cat_saved_me_once/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "EtherRabbit0418", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2gqprcp3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1540400406, "domain": "self.relationships", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9r1hj4/me_f_22_not_receiving_oral_from_my_bf_m27_is/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9r1hj4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "new", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "[new]", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 52, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/9r1hj4/me_f_22_not_receiving_oral_from_my_bf_m27_is/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1540400407, "score": 1, "selftext": "We've been together for 3 years.

Still hasn't done it. \nIt's frustrating to me because i know it's something i enjoy and I understand him feeling insecure because he has little to no experience but practice makes perfect! Every time i see it done in porn, it makes me a little sad that i haven't had any in years. I feel like he should be willing to do it.

I'm gonna sort of vent out my feelings and thoughts here.\n\nI've always considered myself a great listener. And i do my best to help people by giving out any advice or just comfort if needed. This is something I don't think he's good at. I feel i am always there listening to him, whatever it may be. But he is so dismissive of the things i say. This includes me talking about my opinions, school work, my family, etc. His responses are usually one word or just a face, then we move on to talk about him. It really bothers me and I've brought it up before but i see no change. \nHe does not kiss me in front of others. For example, if we're meeting up and others are coming along, he won't even kiss me hello. It sometimes makes me feel like he's embarrassed of me because when i brought it up, he said it makes him feel weird. And i understand that some people don't like pda but i can't help but feel like im not good enough or important enough. This ties in with another problem, when we're out with others i feel left out. He physically turns his back on and excludes me from conversations. I think I am a very socially aware person and it just makes me feel crappy.\nNot long ago, i told him i felt he wasn't attracted to me as much anymore because the sex wasn't the same anymore. We used to have so much passion. I told him that my body needed to be stimulated too, not just his. I felt like sex was becoming a chore and not a fun activity. I also mentioned that i'd like some oral sex too which he's never done since we started dating and i have no problem giving it to him but damn, return the favor! So far no oral sex from him has occurred but he has worked on some foreplay. \nI care about him and love him but sometimes it's draining to think about all this. Am i exaggerating? Its hard to deal with sometimes.
