It feels like a curse living through it everyday having something always causing you harm and feeling the odds against in my favor in life.

Or maybe outside religious views, it's just nature toying with me.\n\nSorry to sound confusing heh.. maybe it would he nice to solidify all of the roaming thoughts racing in my head regarding taking \"Option 2\" or just get help and send me away.\n\n\nI appreciate everyone who has the time and patience to read through this..
