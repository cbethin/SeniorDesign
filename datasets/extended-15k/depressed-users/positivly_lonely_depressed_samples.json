had it for roughly 2 1/2 years, so i'm not typically that happy or energetic, but ever since i met my current best-friend/partner yeah i know, it sounds clich\u00e9 but so be it, iv'e been the happiest person in the world, i have been outside more in the time iv'e known her than in the previous year probably, and i have no idea what she sees in me or why she loves me, but i just try to hold on to this for as long as possible.\n\n \n\nOk thats enough of this back to the story, so my parents are extremely tight with rules and even tho i'm 16 they keep treating me as a little child, i guess you could say i love my parents but i don't understand what they think they'll win from treating me like a baby. but anyways i came home last wednesday at 11:30pm a bit before my curfew and i was SO happy i can't stress it enough i was so happy, i opened the door and the first thing my dad told me was, where the f\\*\\*k have you been, i told him i texted mom where i was i thought she told you, well he screamt at me and i cant exactly translate it since i'm from Finland and our languages don't exactly translate clearly but anyways, after he was done screaming and calling me a failure and a mistake my mom decided to step in, i thought she was gonna support my view and tell my dad to calm down but no, she started screaming at me for not looking in her eyes when she was talking telling me to get out of her sight and that im grounded, i still to this day have no idea what i did wrong but there has to be something i did wrong right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Back to why i told all of you my mental illnesses is because then you might have a guess what happened next, i went to my room like my mom asked me and i locked the door, whats special about my door is that the only way u can open it if its locked is from the inside, so i have perfect privacy in my room but that is past the point, i laid on my bed for a solid 15 minutes just sobbing, and i called my friend, u know the one i told you all about in the beginning, she asked whats wrong and i told her, she told me to wait outside she'll come get me (she's a year older than me so she has a car, but i told her they would kill me if i try to leave, so she just suggested i call, so i did its fairly normal that we just talk on the phone so neither thought anything was weird, we talked for a solid 2 hours until she fell asleep on the phone, there is something so calming about hearing someone fall asleep on the phone with you, i feel like its the ultimate sign of trust someone can show you, i dont know why but i do, well when i was going to go to sleep i got rushed by these emotions, to name a few there was self hatred, suicidal thoughts, self harming thoughts, thoughts about her finding someone better and leaving me, that was probably the worst thought of them all now that i think about it, well i did the one thing iv'e done plenty of times before, took out the pencil sharpener, and the small bit of metal i have on my bed side to unscrew the screw holding the blade in place, i cleaned the blade and proceded to cut my entire left arm, 14 cuts on my arm, all bleading, i started feeling dizzy so i put on a hoodie and tried to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhen i woke up it was like no one knew, well no one knew so theres that, i havent told the most important in my life yet and i dont know if is hould because she would feel tremendous guilt because she fell asleep, and i dont want that since she is also kind of on the edge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni felt like someone needed to know so here it is\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOm du ser deh\u00e4r S, jag \u00e4lskar dig \u00f6ver allting i v\u00e4rlden och jag ville inte f\u00e5 dig och k\u00e4nna dig skyldig f\u00f6r det \u00e4r du inte\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm also sorry for my rant and my horrible english, thank you for reeading", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression",
