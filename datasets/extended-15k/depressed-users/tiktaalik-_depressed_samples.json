My story can honestly be skipped over if you don\u2019t have an interest. Really, my main goal here is to read your guys\u2019 replies and see if I could maybe help in even the slightest way. I have been in an incredibly dark place, and I want to see if (now that it\u2019s become more manageable) I could do anything to help the community I\u2019ve been a part of for a few years.\n\nMy story:\nI\u2019m 21 now, and I had suffered from what I believed to be major depression for the past three years or so. I had tried many SSRIs over that time to no avail. I\u2019m in college and, in those three years, I fucked up and had to withdraw from two semesters and I took one off thinking that it would give me the time I needed to get better. I was very suicidal and had made two attempts at it. I have always had close friends and a good family, but I constantly felt alone. I lacked the motivation to get out of bed and do work, I slept more than 12 hours every day, I lost 15lb (and I was and am a pretty thin guy) in that time, and I\u2019d isolate myself only seeing my roommate for weeks at a time. My family and friends saw just how bad things were getting, and they tried their best to give me help. Therapy proved to be utterly useless (as I\u2019m sure it is to many of you). I even managed to weasel my way out of being hospitalized many times because I thought that forced isolation from those I knew would only exacerbate everything.\n\nI guess my family had repressed their mental illness for years until they got naturally kind of better after decades \u2014 my father still refuses to tell me about his life from his early twenties to his mid-thirties. It turns out that my paternal side of the family has a long history of undiagnosed bipolar. It wasn\u2019t until early this year did my mania start to develop. Only once that started to evolve and show its face as a genuine tell to my problem did I start getting useful help. I\u2019ve been receiving effective medication as of midway through this summer. I have my depression well-managed as of right now, and I haven\u2019t suffered from a debilitating episode in months. I still get days where I feel unmotivated to do anything, but they pass in a day or so. While my mania isn\u2019t properly treated, living through long periods of a lightened mood, being overly energetic (in a bad way), and many sleepless nights, I have not felt this in-control with my mind in years. I am diagnosed with bipolar I (meaning that my manic episodes are more intense than those with BP1) and I may have been up for more than two days straight at this point, but I\u2019d take this any day over the depression.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to give off that clich\u00e9 of \u201cit gets better\u201d like it\u2019s curable, but it can get manageable and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not here as a \u201csuccess story\u201d because it\u2019s really not. I never triumphed \u2014 and never will \u2014 over it; I still get deeply disheartened and feel like garbage when I think too deeply about how, without my medication, I would have likely killed myself by this point: I decided in January that I would if I didn\u2019t get better this semester, and I know that I would have. I\u2019m a chemist who works in a research lab with too many options for an easy-way out. To elaborate further on why I get disheartened, it\u2019s comes during those sobering moments when I contemplate how I would be hopeless in overcoming this without psychiatric help by any way of personal means (exercising, \u201cgoing out in the world,\u201d introspection, eating healthy, etc.). But, like I said, my story isn\u2019t one of success; I see it more aptly described as a survival story as I\u2019m sure you would if (once) you get in a better place. Okay, that\u2019s all I really wanted to say about myself.\n\nWhy I\u2019m actually here:\nI want to hear your story. Whether you\u2019re hitting rock-bottom and at your wit\u2019s end, you\u2019re surely and quickly declining, you\u2019re on the path to getting effective treatment, or if you\u2019ve overcome the odds and temptations and are in a better place; what matters to me is you at this point. I hope that you feel comfortable enough to open up to me. I\u2019ll try to reply as soon as I can to each and every one of you, that\u2019s a promise. I will be putting down my phone and taking my antipsychotic to force myself to sleep in a minute, so I won\u2019t be replying for some time though. I only have mad love for you guys.\n\nAll the best from ya boy,\nTiktaalik-", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 398337, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hey.
