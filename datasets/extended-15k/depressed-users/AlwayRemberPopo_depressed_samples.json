Currently I'm taking antidepressants, and making frequent visits to a psychotherapist. I've been on antidepressants for almost 2 years now, and also tried different ones. I haven't finished university, and it is extremely difficult to continue knowing I have no passion. I've been working 3 jobs for the time being. I don't enjoy any of them, but it's very important to stay out of the house; having social interaction. Money was never a concern in my life, because I have nothing in particular I want to buy.\n\nI don't have any friends that stick around to share personal thoughts. People just slowly fade away and live their own lives. I lost my confidence knowing that I was severely behind in progression. Aside from interactions with work, I don't really talk to anybody\n\nTaking antidepressants makes my world very black and white. My mind is blank and my emotions are numb. It definitely helps control my anxiety issues at least a little.\n\nI broke up with my girlfriend 2 years ago. Zero contact since then. The time together was short but very memorable and lovely. I was truly blissful being loved back; what an amazing sensation. I couldn't let her suffer when I was such a mess, and broke off. I was crying for weeks and probably the lowest I've ever felt. I think about her a lot still, and wish I could talk again. I don't plan to meet her again, since things are already over, so it's whatever.\n\nI never got along with family either, which is a main reason for my stress.\n\nHobbywise, I play games and watch shows or cat videos. There are times its difficult to do any of those when depressed though. Going out to do activities is miserable because I constant wish I was home. \n\nWith all that said, is there anything else you may suggest for me?\n\nThanks for your time.
