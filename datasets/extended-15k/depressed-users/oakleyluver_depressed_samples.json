Googling symptoms it appears like it might be bicep tendinitis. \n\nIt\u2019s interfering with sleep, cramping, warm to the touch, tender to the touch. Pain is worst when I try to move my arm back, but reaching my arm across my chest hurts badly too. Motion is limited in these ways.   I can extend my arm and turn palm upside down. The pain has been interfering with changing clothes or washing my hair. The pain is pretty severe but not unbearable. \n\nThe skin isn\u2019t bruised. Doesn\u2019t appear to be any super significant swelling. \n\nIs this something I should go to the doctor for? If it is bicep tendinitis, sounds like most treatment is at home care. I\u2019m in college so I have to carry my backpack (which can be pretty heavy), and I also have chemistry lab which would require a fair amount of arm movement (pretty much any movement of the arm causes pain).

He was abused and as a result has a really bad temper and poor communication skills which has caused a lot of issues, but we can normally get through them. I\u2019ve gone with him to his therapy sessions before to work through some of these issues. \n\nI\u2019ve been a bad friend lately. I\u2019ve been controlling and insecure and worried that he will abandon me as he makes new friends in college. While I\u2019m not trying to make any excuses for me being toxic, a big part of it comes from my mental health, which I\u2019ve been failing at properly working on. \n\nLast week, we got into an argument after he chose to cancel a visit to see me to stay at his campus to go to a friends birthday party. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t fair to say he doesn\u2019t care about me because he cancelled our visit for someone else, but I honestly still am kinda hurt that we had plans and he cancelled them. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since that fight. I apologized to him after spending some time and realizing how terribly I\u2019ve treated him over the past few months by being so needy. In the past week, I actually went to the counseling center on campus. So I\u2019m going to start a long term therapy program, change my depression medications around (though it will be a few weeks until the psychiatrist can see me), and am starting a group therapy for how to have healthy relationships. I\u2019m not going to be cured overnight but I am making the steps to change that I promised him I would in my apology. \n\nHe won\u2019t speak to me, and honestly it\u2019s okay if people get into fights and take time away from each other, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m okay with how he treats me when he\u2019s mad. The last thing he said to me is \u201cwhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d (When he does get upset he often says rude things. For example, he\u2019s told me that I\u2019m too fat for a boy to ever be attracted to me. So he does have a history of being pretty toxic to me too). He ignored my apology. But when he\u2019s in contact with other friends, he talks about plans when I visit his campus next (implying he still thinks we are friends and everything\u2019s okay but he is just choosing to not speak to me right now). \n\nI think it\u2019s unfair to completely ignore me for however long he wants, not tell me directly if he\u2019s planning on being friends with me again, and not communicate about this issue at all. This has been a long term problem in our relationship that he says he\u2019ll change but never does. He doesn\u2019t communicate, and when he gets upset (or I get upset with something he does), he disappears until he\u2019s ready to just ignore the issue and act like the fight never happened, so nothing gets worked out. \n\nI realize the fight started from my actions, so it\u2019s not fair for me to say if he\u2019s allowed to be upset or how long he\u2019s allowed to be upset. My issue is that he knows when he completely ignores me that it hurts me, and he\u2019s okay just shutting me out, leaving me to think he\u2019s not friends with me, even though in his mind he thinks he can just come back whenever. \n\nHe\u2019s my best friend and most of the time things are really good. He\u2019s like family to me. But I don\u2019t know if I should hold onto a friendship where the other person won\u2019t communicate to fix our issues and will just ignore me when his temper goes off. We both have serious issues, but I\u2019m the only one who ever admits when I do something wrong. And I\u2019m unable to really fix these issues with him because he won\u2019t discuss our issues. \n\nDo I give him time to contact me because I\u2019m the one that messed up? If so, how long is fair? Do I even have a right to be hurt over how he\u2019s treating me? \n\nTldr: I caused an argument with my friend, so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s fair to be upset with how he\u2019s responding, but he constantly chooses to just disappear or say rude things when he gets upset with me for as long as he wants. Since I\u2019m the one that hurt him, do I just be patient, or is it time to end the relationship with him if he doesn\u2019t respect me when he\u2019s upset?
