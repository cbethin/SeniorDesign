My mum doesn't seem to get this. So I've got the constant background anxiety of my mum ringing my phone or texting me (I need to respond within 10 minutes or she gets mad), and need to keep stopping work briefly to check my phone every 20 minutes. She sometimes just TURNS UP as well, and expects me to drop everything and come with her for a \"coffee break\", even if I'm in the middle of a practice exam paper or something.\n\nIt's getting to the point where I fear even leaving the house because I know how stressful it will be whilst I'm out, and how afraid I will be to come home. Home definitely isn't fun, but at least I don't have the constant anxiety of trying to explain to my mum that I CAN'T go for coffee now , I'm working, yes I'm sorry I missed your text, I was busy finishing an essay, no I didn't mean it, etc. which massively affects how much I can work.

Hugs and shaking hands makes me INCREDIBLY uncomfortable, not only because it's touch, but also because I feel trapped (probably as a result of her trapping me in a corner when she wanted to yell).\n\nBut at the same time, because so much physical affection was withheld as a punishment when I was young, I crave physical touch from loved ones. When I imagine having a partner, the thing I think about most is hugging, holding hands, snuggling etc. Just having somebody who I feel safe and comfortable enough with to hug without feeling uncomfortable or afraid they're going to use it against me.

I mean, part of me is thankful that they never have to go through the shit I face on a daily basis, but you've made it so they don't even BELIEVE me when I say you treat me badly!

For someone who likes cleanliness, you sure know how to mess up your kid's head, so well fucking done for that I guess!!\n\nAnd when I have the AUDACITY to stop talking to you as much, suddenly I'm a \"terrible, hateful child\" who's \"ruining the relationship\".

If I want to go somewhere, but she doesn't approve, she'll either guilt-trip me into staying or she'll just straight up stop it from happening. (EG arranged to meet up with my best friend for a film. She called his parents to say \"sorry, he can't come\". Couldn't bring myself to explain to my friend that she had lied to them, so I ended up going along with it).\n\nAs a result of this, of how controlling she is of my life, I never feel fully alone. But not in a good way, like I feel supported or loved, it's more like I feel as if cameras or something are constantly watching my every move, even when I'm in the house alone, in a different person's house, or out in town. Whenever I do something that I'm not sure she'll approve of, I immediately try to come up with a reason why I did it or why it's alright, even if I KNOW she doesn't know I've done it. Like the other day I ate a bunch of junk food, Mcdonald's, pizza, icecream - unhealthy food is something she hugely disapproves of, despite the fact that I exercise daily, mostly eat well and am in reasonably good shape. As I ate the Mcdonald's, I realized I was actually muttering out loud to myself, saying \"it's alright, it's just the once, I've eaten healthily every other day\", and I was imagining myself explaining it to her. It's like that all the time. Any time I do something that I don't know for sure she'd approve of (and even things she does approve of), I automatically try to explain why I did it. I always feel watched and it ends up making me paranoid and afraid that I could be \"caught\", even if there's literally no way she could ever find out what I'm doing and nothing wrong with what I'm doing.

I am an 18 year old man and still live with my parents. I have realized recently that the way my mom treats me is not normal. After a lot of research I found that she has a LOT of narcissistic traits/symptoms. But at the same time I feel very guilty calling her a narcissist or abusive or anything, despite knowing that many things she says and does are wrong. \n\nExamples of her behavior: Gaslighting (a term I only found recently but it describes her actions). HUGE victim complex - she defines herself with the \"problems\" at home (not that there are many), and she constantly parades the issues around. She won't ask about what others are going through, it's always her problems that are important. On the few occasions where I've spoken to her about MY feelings, it has backfired and she uses it against me.\n\nIf she is ever criticized or even if I have a different opinion to her, she blows up completely and either screams or guilt-trips me into submission. She also deliberately does things that she knows will upset me. \n\nAs an example, about 3 weeks ago I went out with some friends for the whole day (something I rarely get the chance to do). We went to this dirt-biking place and I had the most fun I've had in well over a year. My pants got trashed with mud, but not to the point that they were unwearable (as in, it was just stains), and I liked it because they reminded me of the fun I'd had. \n\nLol, not any more I guess. 2 days after the day out, she threw them away, without my permission or even my knowledge (didn't find out until hours after she'd taken them to the dump), with full knowledge that I liked the mudstains and wanted to keep them. I got annoyed/upset because of this and told her she shouldn't have done that, and her response was to cry about how much I hate her and how I'm a terrible person because I got annoyed at her. Later she gaslighted me, saying she never said any of those things and saying I gave her permission to throw the pants away. Since then, she still hasn't gotten over it and is holding a grudge, making really sarcastic and degrading comments about \"how I talk to her\" and \"how I treat her\". \n\nI don't know, I'm just new to all of this and need advice on how to cope or deal with it, because I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I'm mostly sure she's narcissistic, but as I said I feel guilty calling her that because she has supported me before... although at the same time, she uses that fact against me, \"look at all I've done for you\" sort of thing. She used to hit me when I was younger, but I'm just confused, I don't know whether that would count as abuse or just normal disciplining.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "subreddit_subscribers": 305545, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need advice, new to all of this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9ohhwm/need_advice_new_to_all_of_this/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
