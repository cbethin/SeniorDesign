Operates out of offices in the capital city of each country in Eurasia as well as Hong Kong.\nThe leader of this organization is a cape by the name of **Oblivion** who is a stranger 12 who has the passive ability to be forgotten slowly over the course of about a day, has the ability to give basically a Regent reset to people, and he has the ability to cause people to be forgotten completely besides written and video documents and from his memory. He is not known of though and currently runs his organization through three capes who are extremely supportive to other heroes including Oblivion:\n\n**Epicenter** - Trump 8, Shaker 3\nGrace Mushin ~28 yrs.o.\nEpicenter creates pulses of power, sometimes manifesting themselves as physical pulses in the earth or air. She can modify the frequency by focusing, and the longer the wavelength the more focus required. The amplitude of the wave decreases over distance like sound.\nWhile a cape is at the peak of the wave, the strength of their power is greatly increased, but the control they have is slightly decreased. At the middle, both strength and control are somewhat increased. In the troughs, power is somewhat decreased, but control increases greatly.\n\nBy: /u/XerxesPraelor\n\n**Iris**, Thinker 7\nIris can share awareness among herself and any number of willing participants. In order to start the link, Iris must touch her subjects, but this contact is not required to continue the link. Once the link is established, everyone involved has access to everyone else\u2019s senses, which they can tap into at will. The link seems to work with no delay over any earthly distance. Participants can leave the link at any time they choose, but can only re-join the link after touching Iris.\nParticipants in the link can also communicate very simple ideas to every member of the link. Things like \u201chelp,\u201d \u201cattack,\u201d \u201cretreat,\u201d or \u201ccome here\u201d are as complicated as messages can get, and they cannot be sent to specific people -- the entire group \u201chears\u201d every message.\nThe downside to Iris\u2019s powers is that she cannot distinguish her own senses and thoughts from the senses and messages being transmitted through her network. As a result, she can only use her power when safely restrained in a secure area, usually in the Triad headquarters, or an armored vehicle if she has to be close to the action.\n\nby /u/NamedByAFish\n\n**Tanpo** (Japanese for Collateral)\nBreaker 8, Striker 6, Trump 4\nTanpo's ability allows him to delegate energy forces to the surrounding area in a particular field around him. As a consequence blows that might strike Tanpo, have their energy resdistributed in a large field around him, granting him considerable Brute capabilities. Say an energy blast were to hit Tanpo, it would instead be redistributed into the ground around him - hence his name\nTanpo's abilities allow him to redstribute the energy around his fellow allies - though the higher the number of allies he tries to protect, the less efficiently he can redistribute energy (aka the lesser the brute durability)\nIn addition to this Tanpo is capable of striking with the explosive energy of whatever powers are currently in action within his field. That is to say, were another brute to be fighting H2H, Tanpo would have the striking ability of said brute, in addition to any blaster or tinker weapons being fired at that moment.\n\nby /u/actually_accountable", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "protectoreddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_38656", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Eurasian Triad", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/protectoreddit/comments/367zri/the_eurasian_triad/"}, {"author": "White-Fox110", "author_flair_css_class": "12", "author_flair_text": "Oblivion", "created_utc": 1431818243, "domain": "self.Parahumans", "edited": 1431826150, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/367n0f/prt_ratings_in_alph/", "id": "367n0f", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 54, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Parahumans/comments/367n0f/prt_ratings_in_alph/", "retrieved_on": 1440731909, "score": 16, "selftext": "What would you rate heroes from our world?
