Ever since, my psychologist has been trying to figure out what caused my depression. She thinks there's two options; autism or a trauma. However, I did some tests and they showed I do not have autism. I don't feel like I'm traumatized either. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember and I honestly don't think there's any reason for it. \n\nNow, my psychologist doesn't know what to do anymore. She wants to hand my case over to a psychiatrist. My current psychologist is my second psychologist in a year and I've spoken to other psychologists before. I don't see what a psychiatrist could do, what all these psychologists couldn't. I don't want to take any medication, especially not addictive medication. I know medication works for some people, but I don't want to risk it. Depression runs in my family and I've seen some very bad reactions to antidepressants. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips? I don't know what to do anymore. I've talked to so many people and none of them could help me.
