I started having symptoms from accidentally consuming a large amount of cilantro extract/malic acid. This caused a redistribution effect and subsequent cognitive decline.  I have above the standard safe levels of lead, mercury, thallium in a urine and blood analysis. I am feeling worthless, depressed, and tired of life. I'm at the end of the rope, it is difficult to be hopeful or optimistic. I am trapped at my extremely religious parent's house until I am treated for this. They allow people from their church to forcibly try and convert me and make me read stupid propaganda books because I am not in the condition to object.       \n\n I am absolutely fed up. I try my best to be rational and calm, but a person can only take so much. I've been putting up with depression on/off for most of my life.  I have Bipolar type 2 (in my case there are extremely depressed periods and then periods of spontaneous manic inspiration).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I\u2019ll spare some of the details to make this post as concise as possible (sorry if this still ends up being long.)   I have always been reasonably bright, but that was the only good attribute I have ever really had. I am skinny with a baby face, I am not that funny, and I am not outgoing. My social skills are garbage because I had an extremely toxic childhood( crazy religious fundamentalist parents who believed \u201cthe rod\u201d was the best form of discipline.)    Now I don\u2019t even have the one thing that made my life worth living. I can\u2019t focus, I have brain fog and headaches all of the time. I have not been able to go to college. I am always tired, and my preexisting mental health condition is worse. Every day that I have to breathe is absolute torture. The worst part is that I am only 18, and my life is basically on halt. I am trapped with my toxic family until I can get better. The \u201cElders\u201d from my parent\u2019s church think that this is a prime time to try and convert me because I am sick. They feel that they have the right to just come into the house and demand to \u201cstudy\u201d with me. I am absolutely fed up with this. With all of these disgusting parasites slowly eating away at my life, I had to ask what is left? Is there anything even worth salvaging? \n\n I am at the end of the rope. The only things that are keeping me alive are my little brother, and knowing that I will undergo treatment for this, and if it works out well I can finally escape this hell hole. Sadly, even then there is no guarantee that there won\u2019t be lasting damage. The treatment (chelation therapy) has risks as well. It is also uncomfortable, and it takes a long time.  I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like I was given all of the weird shitty cards in life, and by shitty I mean the faded cards with shoe prints from under the table tier shitty. I am generally against the defeatist type attitude, but so much bad luck has piled up so quickly and so early on in my life. Things are just so unfair, the world is just too unforgiving.  \n\nTo fold or not to fold...
