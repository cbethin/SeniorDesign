Venting or asking advice on the internet about my personal life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had sleep and mood disorders for as long as I can remember.\n\nI've never committed to anything. I'm a developer. Probably not the worst, but I don't consider myself a good one either. Never practiced enough to actually get good, as with anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love music but I never managed to learn to play any instrument.\n\nI started a few sports but never kept going for more than a year or two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a few relationships. Most didn't last a month.\n\nThe last one lasted one year, more or less. It was the only one where I actually felt we were on the same wavelength.\n\nIt's been a year or so, now. I've barely tried to meet anyone else since then. Going on dating sites only depresses me.\n\nI'm afraid that last girl was the best I'll ever get to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but that makes me a fat lot of good.\n\nI've seen a dozen of doctors, been given all sorts of medication, from antidepressants to anxiolytics to antipsychotics.\n\nI'm not sure anything ever helped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIronically, I'm not in bad shape, aside from that.\n\nI have a decent job,  never had any problem with money, and I'm OK-looking.\n\nI'm also male and white, and I live in a developed country.\n\nIt kind of makes me feel I shouldn't be whining so much, yet here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI attempted suicide a couple times in the past. That thought still comes up now and then.\n\nIt passes. Like everything else. Like my enthusiasm. Like my desire to do anything.\n\nDays, months, years go by, seldom terrible, dull most of the time.\n\nIt appears I could go on living like this until I die, however that happens.\n\nSleepwalking through life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes I think there might be ways out of this swamp.\n\nMeeting the right people, maybe. Finding something I can actually commit to.\n\nSomething to break the circle.\n\nBut whenever I manage to start an activity, try to meet new people or pick up some good habits, a night of insomnia or a period of depression brings everything down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the first time I post this kind of stuff, and possibly the last, since I've always regarded theses posts as hopeless. Posts of the lots of suffering people I've read and never replied to.\n\nOf course I must still have some hope, or I wouldn't be doing it in the first place.\n\nBut even as I write this I'm thinking What's the point?
