I'm 19 years old and I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, Aspergers and insomnia. I've been medicated for about 2 years now and have seen tremendous results, but medication isn't always consistent *with* those results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up as a kid, I've always been very goal-determined. I always believed that having money would be a cure-all to my childhood depression. That having a loving partner would make the feelings subside. That being successful wouldn't make you feel like a failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI speak from experience because I value my history and what I've accomplished, yet it worries me how I can be the way I am while living such a successful life. My anxiety led to me dropping out of school as a Freshman; about 14 years old. I don't have a diploma, I don't have a GED, I've never even looked at a college and I have no ambition to. I started teaching myself the stock market because finances and marketing analytics were always interesting to me through my years of 'gold-farming' in World of Warcraft. Through this passion, I now self-employ myself as a stock broker. I work from home, I'm paying off my families assets, and they've never been more proud of me... *Yet,* I feel worthless to some extent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI struggle to socialize with people, and the ones involved in my life I become very attached to. I have strong emotions, I'm a loving and caring person, but I don't have many people to hang out with. I have a few very special people in my life, but I'm afraid that I bombard them with all of my feelings since I can't diversify my attention. I feel like I could overwhelm the people in my life and lead to creating an even deeper issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really lonely, but I work from home and do nothing. I play video games and do my stocks, that's about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTyping this out makes me feel better, and hopefully someone can share a similar story and feel less alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife is a beautiful thing, it's never worth giving up. \n\nBut it can surely kick your ass.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra, and My Chemical Romance. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.  (*If you like Vanilla World of Warcraft and play/would like to play on vanilla servers, HUGE BONUS POINTS.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this?

This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves.

I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)

Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAloneDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpe", "subreddit_subscribers": 40645, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] I dropped out of school at 14.

I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance.

Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra, and My Chemical Romance. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.  (*If you like Vanilla World of Warcraft and play/would like to play on vanilla servers, HUGE BONUS POINTS.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)

Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life.

I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAloneDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpe", "subreddit_subscribers": 40613, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] I dropped out of school at 14.

The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "r4r", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rn0e", "subreddit_subscribers": 189371, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] I dropped out of school at 14.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra, and My Chemical Romance. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.  (*If you like Vanilla World of Warcraft and play/would like to play on vanilla servers, HUGE BONUS POINTS.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't?

I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was influenced by the mature people I hung out with on a regular basis. One person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold\\*,\\* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "r4r", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rn0e", "subreddit_subscribers": 189046, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] I dropped out of school at 14.

This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold\\*,\\* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAloneDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpe", "subreddit_subscribers": 40575, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] I dropped out of school at 14.

I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't?

I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was influenced by the mature people I hung out with on a regular basis. One person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', My Chemical Romance and Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was influenced by the mature people I hung out with on a regular basis. One person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold\\*,\\* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)

Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra, and My Chemical Romance. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.  (*If you like Vanilla World of Warcraft and play/would like to play on vanilla servers, HUGE BONUS POINTS.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "r4r", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rn0e", "subreddit_subscribers": 188640, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] - Anywhere.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra, and My Chemical Romance. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.  (*If you like Vanilla World of Warcraft and play/would like to play on vanilla servers, I'll cream.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAloneDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpe", "subreddit_subscribers": 40403, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] - Anywhere.

I've supported Vanilla for years, actively play on servers and am looking forward to the progression of classic. My opinion on Vanilla and BFA will be biased in that regard.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI play pretty much all Blizzard games except Hearthstone. The Majority of time-spent in playing Blizzards' games goes into World of Warcraft. I've been playing the game at a ridiculously hardcore level for over a decade, have seen 13 world firsts and always had the ambition to push the hardest I can achieve regardless of how shitty a raid was. This has changed in BFA. The game no longer appeals to me, I've finally quit the game after playing since vanilla. I understand that you can't please everyone, but as a hardcore raider (*who does not speak for all hardcore raiders*) I'm not happy with WoW. Classes seem bare, tank balance is a joke, Mythic Uldir has been very questionable and puts a huge red light on the supposed internal raid testing teams that you have for mythic (MOTHER being bugged for 36 hours post-launch, unkillable Fetid, no Mythrax laser animation, Zul DoT, etc.) It goes to show that ultimately there is less care towards this area of the game. And that's ok, there are other areas of content that need to be enjoyed as well. Like Island Expeditions ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo summarize my feelings for WoW before moving on, I'm very excited for Classic and still play on vanilla servers. Thank you for listening to your playerbase in regards to that, please do that again in regards to what's happening now. The Classic scene is a huge mess, you have BFA players and Nostalgia-boys clashing on the forums. BFA players have and should never have a say towards to Vanilla, and unsubbed nostalgic private server players should have no say towards retail. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not the **biggest** Diablo fan. Especially after last night, but it's not my most played Blizzard title. Diablo 1/2 were masterpieces, Diablo 3 was *OK.* But how can a company as powerful such as Activision-Blizzard have absolutely no grasp of their community in regards to what they want. I quit Diablo 3 for Path of Exile, to be blunt, it is a much better game. Blizzard obviously is aware of its success. That should inspire them to push the boundaries and make something to their standards. Having a mobile Diablo just seems like they're giving up with the market. \"Let GGG have this one, we'll win on the App Store and Asian Markets.\" If you can devote the resources to remastering WC3, you can definitely devote a small team of devs to remastering 1/2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea of a mobile Diablo ***is not*** a bad idea. It makes sense, people do enjoy the leisure of playing video games outside their home/computer, and Diablo is no different. I'm not saying that Blizzard should be embarrassed for making a mobile Diablo game. Blizzard should be embarrassed for announcing this project among all the speculation of what will happen with Diablo; among all Warcraft fans who had their childhood brought back to life with the WC3 remaster. ***I know that Blizzard said they had multiple reveals later to be announced, but I honestly don't believe it. I think they preemptively said this for the obvious retaliation they would receive after announcing Mobile Diablo as their face for the Diablo Blizzcon booth.*** Maybe D4 or a remaster announcement will show up in a few months and I'll look like a complete idiot. I hope that's the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Blizzard, I love you like an abusive father. I used to throw my wallet at everything you would show me, now I'm skeptical with how you've turned out.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Diablo fans deserve better, the WoW fans deserve better, and Blizzard themselves deserves better. They built a titan of a reputation as one of the best game companies in the world. Don't let bad ideas ruin your reputation, keep your integrity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast Note : The censorship of people on YouTube/Reddit and the reuploads of the Diablo trailer is baffling. You're better than that, Blizz. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\na fan.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAloneDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpe", "subreddit_subscribers": 40339, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] - Anywhere.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra, and My Chemical Romance. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, insomnia and Aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, one person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.)* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube.

I work from home and I have a sarcastic and outgoing personality and I love to spend time with people. I'm reliable, honest, caring and I'm currently looking for someone to share my passions with. I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't? Favorite artists at the moment are Joji, anything 'Lo-Fi', and Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra. I'm looking for a partner who has a generous amount of free time to spend with one another. If you're interested, feel free to browse the paragraphs below to learn more about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*When browsing these types of subreddits, one of my biggest complaints is lack of information. So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was influenced by the mature people I hung out with on a regular basis. One person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold\\*,\\* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts.

I've been a professional gamer for the past decade and have been to multiple tournaments. I also watch Netflix, anime, horror movies and play basketball. I also love music, who doesn't?

So I figured I'd put anything relevant to me in this post to avoid future issues with misinformation, or me not appealing to someone because of something particular about me. I'm not judging, sometimes people just don't sound like your type. I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was influenced by the mature people I hung out with on a regular basis. One person especially whom I've known for almost a decade I truly consider to be the closest thing I've ever had to dad. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father who I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\"  208lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm often lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, loving and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem empty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm probably not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold\\*,\\* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. I started learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error. I plan to have my grandmothers' house and moms' car paid off within a year, and begin pooling money into my future estate or wherever I decide to go. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?* A lot of my personality comes from my grandfather. He worked his ass off for 50 years to be able to maintain his hobbies. He takes great pride in what he's worked for and bought. Here's an example of one of his rooms:  [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds) (I currently live in a Triplex, My grandparents, mother and I each have our own plot.)  My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, consoles, video games, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing.  Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marijuana** :  Massachusetts went legal!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAloneDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpe", "subreddit_subscribers": 40208, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] - Anywhere.

I'm guilty of it.)* **The below paragraphs are : Life Story, Physical Description, Why I'm Posting Here, What I'm Looking For, What I Look Like, My Hobbies, Random Info.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. If it weren't for my time invested and referrals through other people I knew, no one would ever group up with a retarded 7 year old, but I found my way in somehow. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was heavily impacted by constantly interacting and making friends with more intelligent people. I'm thankful for having the opportunity to figure out the important details and choices I wanted to pursue in life thanks to having a background of father figures who showed me the way. *(Reading this back, it sounds like I had a gay orgy of a family tree.)* That's not the case. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father whom I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\" to 6'6\" depending on shoes. 213lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm lonely at times. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, caring and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem down. Some people have fixations in life; money, love, support: Well, I have 2 of those things, and here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mean to come across as some entitled piece of shit, I'm not that type of person. From my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else. Life is worth sharing, no matter how good your right hand feels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold (*WoW Currency),* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. Eventually after meeting businessmen involved in New York invested in the Stock Exchange among other CryptoCurrencies, Futures and Currency Pairs, I led myself to learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error, and expect to double my savings every half-year. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating? Fag.* First of all, suck my ass. Second of all, thank my grandfather. This is his \"playroom\" : [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds)This is the type of inspiration I have in having things that make people speechless. My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Roleplaying** : \"*Decorating, Doki Doki Literature Club, and now RP... This guy is a flaming monkey\"* I can't use my grandfather as an excuse for this one or else that'd be **extremely** fucking awkward. I had friends that invited me to a WoW Group RP thing. It was a lot of fun, I consider myself a creative writer, I'd do it again; and have had lots of fun in RP servers for Gmod where I can pretend to be a Nazi. (*Fight me: the Sequel)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random video game collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing. I was sponsored by them for a few months, got that shit for free. I still drink it to this day, the shit is like Jesus Juice. Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Blaze that shit, yo** : *If I haven't lost you after gay orgies, decorating, doki doki, RP and collecting Japanese cards with talking animals on them, then for my last pitch:* Massachusetts went legal, babyyyyyyy!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\nPM/chat me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ForeverAloneDating", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpe", "subreddit_subscribers": 40206, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "19 [M4F] - Anywhere.

I started playing in 04' and rank among the top tanks in the world. I've raided with the likes of Midwinter, Method, Death and Taxes, Club Camel and a few others :)\n* I have 2 cats and 1 dog. (2 orange tabbies and a western retriever.)\n* I've been told I have pretty deep voice.\n* If my beard is an issue, I don't mind shaving.\n* I generally only play video games on PC, but I do own the relevant consoles. (Switch, Xbone, PS4)\n* I **love** binge-watching. I'll binge anything from the Office, to American Horror Story, to Dragon Ball.\n* I'm probably the least-picky person when it comes to watching Netflix/Anime, I enjoy the company more than the show itself most times.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to dabble in a bit of chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times.

I'll binge anything from the Office, to American Horror Story, to Dragon Ball.\n* I'm probably the least-picky person when it comes to watching Netflix/Anime, I enjoy the company more than the show itself most times.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to dabble in a bit of chorus.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. Anxiety combined with how poorly I bonded with others (*later diagnosed with Aspbergers)* led to me being absent more than I was there. My mom understood how I felt and stood up for me when the school would call asking why I'm not attending. This led to multiple court-cases which resulted in me stopping school entirely and being home-schooled. I returned to school my Freshman year to see if the new building and new people would make a difference, sadly it didn't. And I left school as a Sophomore. My high school in particular was a brand new building accessible to the majority of the residents. Our class was of an insane two-thousand students. The large crowds would frequently give me panic attacks. (*All of this is pre-medication)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough my insurance agency, ex-therapist and wonderful mother, I found a psychiatrist who after meeting with a few times, was able to diagnose and prescribe me with what I take today. The difference it's made is unbelievable. I still have physical social-awkwardness with people, I can be myself and have conversations with people with no issues, but public places with crowds of people is still uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online as a young kid. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was heavily impacted by constantly interacting and making friends with more intelligent people. I'm thankful for having a mature circle of friends who've helped teach and develop me into the person I am today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\" to 6'6\" depending on shoes. 213lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# My Voice :\n\n# \n\n[https://vocaroo.com/i/s0offVPoqPnL](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0offVPoqPnL) *(Normally these things cringe me out, but I do think it's important to know what someone sounds like. It helps give a bit of an insight to someones' personality.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I often feel lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, caring and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *enjoyable.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else. Life is worth sharing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is weed/booze friendly.\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin\\*,\\* selling music, selling gold\\*,\\* and having a YouTube channel.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. Anxiety combined with how poorly I bonded with others (*later diagnosed with Aspbergers)* led to me being absent more than I was there. My mom understood how I felt and stood up for me when the school would call asking why I'm not attending. This led to multiple court-cases which resulted in me stopping school entirely and being home-schooled. I returned to school my Freshman year to see if the new building and new people would make a difference, sadly it didn't. And I left school as a Sophomore. My high school in particular was a brand new building accessible to the majority of the residents. Our class was of an insane two-thousand students. The large crowds would frequently give me panic attacks. (*All of this is pre-medication)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough my insurance agency, ex-therapist and wonderful mother, I found a psychiatrist who after meeting with a few times, was able to diagnose and prescribe me with what I take today. The difference it's made is unbelievable. I still have physical social-awkwardness with people, I can be myself and have conversations with people with no issues, but public places with crowds of people is still uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online as a young kid. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was heavily impacted by constantly interacting and making friends with more intelligent people. I'm thankful for having a mature circle of friends who've helped teach and develop me into the person I am today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\" to 6'6\" depending on shoes. 213lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I often feel lonely. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, caring and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *enjoyable.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else. Life is worth sharing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is weed/booze friendly.\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin\\*,\\* selling music, selling gold\\*,\\* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I wanted more. Eventually I met people invested in the Stock Market among other CryptoCurrencies, Futures and Currency Pairs, It led me to want to  learn more about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error, and expect to double my savings every half-year. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : My grandfather loves to display his prized possessions.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. If it weren't for my time invested and referrals through other people I knew, no one would ever group up with a retarded 7 year old, but I found my way in somehow.

As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, caring and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem down. Some people have fixations in life; money, love, support: Well, I have 2 of those things, and here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mean to come across as some entitled piece of shit, I'm not that type of person. From my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else. Life is worth sharing, no matter how good your right hand feels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games.

I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold (*WoW Currency),* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. Eventually after meeting businessmen involved in New York invested in the Stock Exchange among other CryptoCurrencies, Futures and Currency Pairs, I led myself to learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error, and expect to double my savings every half-year. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating? Fag.* First of all, suck my ass. Second of all, thank my grandfather. This is his \"playroom\" : [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds)This is the type of inspiration I have in having things that make people speechless. My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Roleplaying** : \"*Decorating, Doki Doki Literature Club, and now RP... This guy is a flaming monkey\"* I can't use my grandfather as an excuse for this one or else that'd be **extremely** fucking awkward. I had friends that invited me to a WoW Group RP thing. It was a lot of fun, I consider myself a creative writer, I'd do it again; and have had lots of fun in RP servers for Gmod where I can pretend to be a Nazi. (*Fight me: the Sequel)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random video game collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing. I was sponsored by them for a few months, got that shit for free. I still drink it to this day, the shit is like Jesus Juice. Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Blaze that shit, yo** : *If I haven't lost you after gay orgies, decorating, doki doki, RP and collecting Japanese cards with talking animals on them, then for my last pitch:* Massachusetts went legal, babyyyyyyy!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\nPM me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** : Hi, I'm Drew. I play video games a lot. I'm romantic, funny and I love spending time with people. I work from home, and I'm lonely most days. I'm looking for someone to regularly hang with to play video games or watch shit together.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. If it weren't for my time invested and referrals through other people I knew, no one would ever group up with a retarded 7 year old, but I found my way in somehow. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was heavily impacted by constantly interacting and making friends with more intelligent people. I'm thankful for having the opportunity to figure out the important details and choices I wanted to pursue in life thanks to having a background of father figures who showed me the way. *(Reading this back, it sounds like I had a gay orgy of a family tree.)* That's not the case. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father whom I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\" to 6'6\" depending on shoes. 213lbs.

When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold (*WoW Currency),* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. Eventually after meeting businessmen involved in New York invested in the Stock Exchange among other CryptoCurrencies, Futures and Currency Pairs, I led myself to learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error, and expect to double my savings every half-year. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating?

Feel free to scroll through the boring stuff. I'll try and organize my paragraphs as best I can.)*  ***TL;DR at the bottom.***\n\n# \n\n# A brief description of my life/career/history :\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. If it weren't for my time invested and referrals through other people I knew, no one would ever group up with a retarded 7 year old, but I found my way in somehow. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was heavily impacted by constantly interacting and making friends with more intelligent people. I'm thankful for having the opportunity to figure out the important details and choices I wanted to pursue in life thanks to having a background of father figures who showed me the way. *(Reading this back, it sounds like I had a gay orgy of a family tree.)* That's not the case. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father whom I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\" to 6'6\" depending on shoes. 213lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm lonely at times. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, caring and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem down. Some people have fixations in life; money, love, support: Well, I have 2 of those things, and here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mean to come across as some entitled piece of shit, I'm not that type of person. From my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else. Life is worth sharing, no matter how good your right hand feels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold (*WoW Currency),* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. Eventually after meeting businessmen involved in New York invested in the Stock Exchange among other CryptoCurrencies, Futures and Currency Pairs, I led myself to learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error, and expect to double my savings every half-year. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating? Fag.* First of all, suck my ass. Second of all, thank my grandfather.

A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an early teen I stopped going to school. I've been involved in multiple court-cases with my elementary school prior to high school due to my absences. I bonded very poorly with kids my age. (*Here's a scenario to explain how* ***poorly*** *I bonded with others : \"Hi, I'm Drew, nice to meet you.\" - \"Hi, I'm Billy! What do you do for fun?\" -  \"I group up with 3 dozen  other middle-aged men and fight dragons and elemental overlords on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from Evening to Midnight. What about you?\" - \"Oh, I just watch football and play my Gamecube.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started playing online at about 5 years old. My moms' ex-husband owned a computer, and my curiosity led me to getting my own a few years later. Through his computer and eventually my own, I found the World of Warcraft. If it weren't for my time invested and referrals through other people I knew, no one would ever group up with a retarded 7 year old, but I found my way in somehow. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was heavily impacted by constantly interacting and making friends with more intelligent people. I'm thankful for having the opportunity to figure out the important details and choices I wanted to pursue in life thanks to having a background of father figures who showed me the way. *(Reading this back, it sounds like I had a gay orgy of a family tree.)* That's not the case. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father whom I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Physical Description (Pictures a few paragraphs down) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6'4\" to 6'6\" depending on shoes. 213lbs. Would like to be down to 190. Not fat, not skinny. Broad shoulders, medium-sized muscles. Hazel eyes, long eyelashes. Dark-brown hair, still figuring out what fucking hairstyle I like. I typically grow out my goatee, my mustache makes me look like a pedophile so I tend to keep it trimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm lonely at times. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, caring and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem down. Some people have fixations in life; money, love, support: Well, I have 2 of those things, and here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mean to come across as some entitled piece of shit, I'm not that type of person. From my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else. Life is worth sharing, no matter how good your right hand feels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hobbies of Mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Video Gaming** : (*Duh.)*  My main game throughout the years has been World of Warcraft (60,000+ hours across a few accounts.)  I have a total of 13 World Firsts, and have been a rank 1 healer/tank for about 20 raid tiers. I'm a former Healing Officer for Midwinter, and former Priest Class Officer for Death and Taxes. I've been to LAN for WoW in the AWC, as well as Heroes of the Dorm, HCG, and local Smash tournaments. (*Pro-Tip, team managers and CEOs' take the majority of the prize pool money, fuck eSports.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music** : I've written music, listen to music, play music and have taught music. You could say I like music. I started simultaneously learning guitar and piano during middle school. After learning how to read/write and developing calluses in my fingertips, I'm able to pick up the majority of strings/brass/woodwinds and learned percussion not too long afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Basketball** : So I accidentally fell in love with basketball. You don't normally find World of Warcraft players on the basketball team. Since I had my growth spurt as an early teen, my gym teacher pitched the idea of playing as a center (*The big guy)* and I absolutely loved the game. I started watching it on TV and eventually played on rec-teams and school teams. Currently at my size, I play PG/SG/SF. I don't play on teams anymore, but I still hoop on my court outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Money!** : When it comes to financial assets and materialistic belongings, I'm the polar opposite of my mother. I take after my grandfathers obsession and OCD with pricey items and pride in owning expensive things. As an introverted and anxious person, I've had many failed attempts at working in retail or some type of minimum-wage local job. I've searched the world near and far to find a sustainable way to support myself without relying on my family. That's how I found streaming as a career. When that died out, I tried everything from Freelancing, managing streamers', eSports, mining BitCoin (*fuck you, don't judge me.),* selling music, selling gold (*WoW Currency),* and having a YouTube channel. The hilarious thing is that most of these actually made livable incomes, but I'm more of a *Rolex* kind of guy, then a *Syrup Sandwiches* type of fellow. Eventually after meeting businessmen involved in New York invested in the Stock Exchange among other CryptoCurrencies, Futures and Currency Pairs, I led myself to learning about investing as a trade. I'm currently taking classes online and teaching myself through trial and error, and expect to double my savings every half-year. *As long as we don't have a sequel to the Great Depression.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Decorating** : *A guy that likes decorating? Fag.* First of all, suck my ass. Second of all, thank my grandfather. This is his \"playroom\" : [https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds](https://imgur.com/a/RfHkWds)This is the type of inspiration I have in having things that make people speechless. My current \"playroom\" is nothing in comparison : [https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q](https://imgur.com/a/bqF5Q2q)  (*Yes, that is Yuri from Doki Doki Literature Club. Fight me.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Roleplaying** : \"*Decorating, Doki Doki Literature Club, and now RP... This guy is a flaming monkey\"* I can't use my grandfather as an excuse for this one or else that'd be **extremely** fucking awkward. I had friends that invited me to a WoW Group RP thing. It was a lot of fun, I consider myself a creative writer, I'd do it again; and have had lots of fun in RP servers for Gmod where I can pretend to be a Nazi. (*Fight me: the Sequel)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Collecting** : This could probably go in the decorating paragraph, but I'm a sucker for collecting shit and displaying it. Whether it be fucking Amiibos', POP figures, posters, rare Pokemon/Yugioh cards in sleeves, random video game collectibles from thrift stores or comic shops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Drinking** : *Since this post has my age, I will refer to what I'm drinking as Dr. Pepper.*  Real talk though, Dr. Pepper is amazing. I was sponsored by them for a few months, got that shit for free. I still drink it to this day, the shit is like Jesus Juice. Since it's technically legal to drink on an owned-property with a parents' consent in my state, I will admit I enjoy the finer tastes of life. I'm a social drinker, too many calories in booze to begin with; but putting some vodka in a Mountain Dew is cool sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Blaze that shit, yo** : *If I haven't lost you after gay orgies, decorating, doki doki, RP and collecting Japanese cards with talking animals on them, then for my last pitch:* Massachusetts went legal, babyyyyyyy!  I don't smoke it, I think it smells like a skunks' asshole, but I sometimes buy disposable vapes and edibles. I do it at most once a week in preparation for social activity, it really is a godsend for people with anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube. Through the genre, I also fell in love with Cyberpunk and Joji. I listen to pretty much anything based on my mood though, here's my Spotify playlist in case people are curious. : [https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png](https://i.imgur.com/5kDU4q5.png)(*My most listened to artists in my playlist that are non-Lo-Fi are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Green Day, David Bowie, Queen, Eminem, Dion, Panic at the Disco, Joji, My Chemical Romance, New Politics, Paramore, Silverstein, Stokeswood, Weezer)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's my fucking Wallpaper Engine Playlist : [https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ](https://imgur.com/a/uajODVZ)   (*Do people give a shit about this? Idk.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \\*fully complete\\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (Not retarded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have a pretty deep voice.\n* I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\n* I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\n* Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\n* I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\n* I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\n* I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth.\n* One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\n* I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\n* I'll probably get a sleeve tat on my arms, not 100% sure though.\n* I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\n* I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\n* I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.\n\nPM me if you're interested :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** : Hi, I'm Drew. I play video games a lot. I'm romantic, funny and I love spending time with people. I work from home, and I'm lonely most days. I'm looking for someone to regularly hang with to play video games or watch shit together.

If it weren't for my time invested and referrals through other people I knew, no one would ever group up with a retarded 7 year old, but I found my way in somehow. The majority of people I played with were adults, so my personality was heavily impacted by constantly interacting and making friends with more intelligent people. I'm thankful for having the opportunity to figure out the important details and choices I wanted to pursue in life thanks to having a background of father figures who showed me the way. *(Reading this back, it sounds like I had a gay orgy of a family tree.)* That's not the case. I'm an only-child of a single mother whom has no contact information of my biological father whom I've never met. I have no intentions of meeting him, but I hold no grudge. Life happens, it sucks, moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why I'm posting here :\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm lonely at times. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself a romantic person. I'm passionate, caring and a good friend. I hold deep connections with those I relate with and I truly want to treat people good for having a meaning in my life. That being said, I come across as a complete asshole sometimes once you get to know me. I'm very satire and sarcastic, it's not genuine. I just like to make people laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for romance. Whether it be sipping Whiskey in a hot tub, cuddled up on a leather sofa watching Bojack Horseman, or a private boat ride on the Atlantic. I think relationships are a beautiful thing and should be cherished and maintained. Not having a significant other can really make your life seem down. Some people have fixations in life; money, love, support: Well, I have 2 of those things, and here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mean to come across as some entitled piece of shit, I'm not that type of person. From my past experiences of being involved in a relationship, it truly does add great features to your life. I'm cursed and blessed with a wealthy and supportive family who would do anything for me, and while I cherish them like nothing else, it's really hard for me to find things to motivate me. Having an easy life doesn't necessarily mean that life is *good.* Anything I *really* want will just get handed to me at some point, and while it's a great thing, it teaches bad practices and it's not something I want to rely on.  I want to support someone else, be a shoulder to cry on, a motivation and an importance to someone else. Life is worth sharing, no matter how good your right hand feels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What I'm looking for :\n\nI'm looking to find a chill female who has time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To avoid wasting peoples' time: I can't really see myself with someone who doesn't play video games. I'm flexible, but this is probably my only 'Deal Breaker.'*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo explain what exactly I'm looking for in **a perfect world** :\n\n* Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\n* Someone who loves video games.\n* Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together.\n* Someone who doesn't get offended.\n* Someone who loves playing video games with a partner.\n* Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\n* Someone who has a voice for themselves. (*This sort of contradicts the last bullet point, I mean this as in you're able to communicate and have conversations with people.)*\n* Someone who is outgoing.\n* Someone who is 420/booze friendly. (*I live in Massachusetts, out of all liberal states, I can't believe MA went pot-legal. Hallelujah.)*\n\n**This is an ideal description, I'm not a '10' by any means, we all have issues, I don't need an ideal person.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I look like this :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR](https://imgur.com/a/RgstPmR)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Here's some random extra information about me :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of games that I currently have downloaded and plan on playing : [https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png](https://i.imgur.com/6rlyDc8.png) *The purpose of this picture is to give a broad idea of what games I play, as you can see, I play literally anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Here's a list of anime I've already seen; I don't mind re-watching, and I'd love to hear recommendations on what I should watch. : [https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png](https://i.imgur.com/3t64l7d.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My favorite genre of music is Lo-Fi Hip Hop, I fell in love with it through the 24/7 \"study and chill\" playlists on YouTube.

I'm around 6'4\", 210lbs (Medium-build; not fat/not skinny)   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my career. Around 3-4 years ago, I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash 2/3 (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety/aspergers and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm posting on Reddit because I'm lonely at times. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. All of my friends are from World of Warcraft, and after playing since 2004, I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after finishing out the current raid tier. The group of people I played with solely stick to either WoW or Overwatch, and I play \\*a lot\\* of games.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking to find chill people who have time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT.

I'm around 6'4, average/medium build. Hazel eyes, dark brown hair.  \n\nI'm a very social person when it comes to bonding and talking online. I have a sarcastic and ironic sense of humor, I love to make people laugh and smile, and I love being a caretaker or shoulder to cry on.  \n\nI'm posting here after lurking for a few days, decided to try things out to see how they go. Things get pretty lonely sometimes, figured this was worth a shot :)  \n\nMy hobbies include playing video games, binge watching anime/netflix, playing basketball (I play PG, used to play in school, now I play whenever friends get together), and socializing with friends online. I've been invested with PC gaming since 04' where I first started playing World of Warcraft. I have a deep passion for the game, and MMOs alike, but I play \\*\\*many\\*\\* other games. For those who know about WoW, I currently raid with multiple guilds (Method, ex-Club Camel, ex-Focus Up.) I'll play literally anything else, I have lots of XP with FPS games, MOBAs, RTS, Isometric RPGs, RPGs in general, and anything else really.

It's just a daily occurrence for me.   \n\n\nSomething that has been somewhat reassuring to know is that I'm not alone in the sense of being entirely unique to this feeling. I 'have' family and friends, but not truly what I seek and desire. Whether or not I need what I'm seeking, my mind fails to recognize any other alternative other than the blind passions I have. \n\nI would never say any of this with my own voice. A monitor lets me portray my emotion without feeling the weight of my words. Whether no-one or everyone sees this; it feels relaxing to see these words in front of me. \n\nI don't know what to call it. Depression, anxiety, plain loneliness? Maybe all, who knows.\n\nI'm grateful to have the freedom to use a platform to ventilate with real people. I/We become isolated in our own thoughts. Many-a-times I feel like I'm a unique individual suffering something unheard of, and feeling the weight of the world; finding the courage to carry onwards. But this isn't an uncommon mindset.\n\nThe nights are terrible. My insomnia keeps me awake at all hours of the night. The isolation, the purposely-picked sad Lo-Fi music (Why do we listen to sad music when we're sad, it makes no sense but I do it anyways.) Even though what I'm feeling hurts, it doesn't hurt to feel. \n\nI fall in love very easily. I've been in a number of relationships; but something I don't see too much of on these discussions are the OP ending the relationship.   \n\n\nI've ruined so many friendships. A girl I interact with through video games, sports, etc. Social interactivity plays its course, relationships strengthen and eventually something connects. And it feels great for a while, and then I feel lonely in the presence of that person. I'm afraid to communicate with people as I'm scared to ruin what's left of my social life.\n\nThis can't be normal. \n\nThe more I think about it, I don't even know what I want. I don't know what would make me happy anymore. I just co-exist in a life that encourages depression and uncertainties. I don't know what would fix me, I don't know what there is to fix. \n\nAll I know is that I'm unhappy. \n\nWith what, I don't know; and haven't for a long time. \n\nI hope someone can relate to this.\n\nThank you for reading this,\n\ntake care everyone.\n\n\\-Drew", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "lonely", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjny", "subreddit_subscribers": 23253, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hopefully someone can relate.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/92svk6/hopefully_someone_can_relate/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "YeahXynni", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_id": "t2_nuhzl", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1531298382, "domain": "self.Anxiety", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8xxvtw/im_really_stuck_right_now/", "id": "8xxvtw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/8xxvtw/im_really_stuck_right_now/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1531298382, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\nI was clinically diagnosed with Aspbergers, agoraphobia, and severe anxiety.

(We hope to maintain a social and respectable community of players.) \n\n[u]What We Expect From You[/u]\n\n[ul]. Attendance: With our raid times, we raid 8 times a month for a combined total of 24 hours. We expect dedicated attendance from raiders unless given future notice of an absent day. (With fair reason, of course.) \n\n. Knowledge of fights: Videos and written guides of how to perform on bosses are essential to raid success. We expect everyone to have taken the time to research the fights on the content we are progressing on. In terms of individual roles on fights where some people are required to do something different (i.e Brackenspore Flamethrower duty) these will be discussed in preparation before pulling the boss. \n\n. Honesty and Communication: If you messed up on something during a boss fight, please bring the attention to the raid, or a whisper to a raid leader. We check logs after every raid, and we see what happens. If we know what's happening while we are working on it, we can assess the problem much faster, and as an entire team. You won't be isolated and laughed at. Raiding is a team experience. \n\n. Knowledge of your class: Not everybody is a world-first raider. We don't expect you to parse in the 100's on a day-to-day basis. We require that you know how to play your class, and that you regularly check up the current build for your class. Theorycrafting is also a great asset towards completely min-maxing your potential.\n\n. Trust in Us: We all share common goals, and we do our best to help everyone. Raiders have access to a stocked guild bank with materials ranging from all Enchanting mats, to raid food, etc. If we have a suggestion for someone, we're not trying to belittle what you're doing, but help you improve and understand how you can perform even better. This goes for all of us. \n\n. Patience: We'll be stuck on some bosses, every guild meets a roadblock. Wiping on a boss for a long time can be frustrating, but losing patience and interest will just result in making the fight harder.

Guild Perks\n\n. Laid back; fun community.\n\n. We do a LOT of Mythic+ (Great way to gear up your toons.) \n\n. If you're not a raider, you can always tag along for our farm night raid clears, and mythic+ runs. \n\n. Active Ventrillo server; we all talk throughout the day; we play other games (Overwatch, Diablo, etc.)\n\n. Active and wealthy guild bank with consistant supplies. \n\n.

(We hope to maintain a social and respectable community of players.) \n\n[u]What We Expect From You[/u]\n\n. Attendance: With our raid times, we raid 8 times a month for a combined total of 24 hours. We expect dedicated attendance from raiders unless given future notice of an absent day. (With fair reason, of course.) \n\n. Knowledge of fights: Videos and written guides of how to perform on bosses are essential to raid success. We expect everyone to have taken the time to research the fights on the content we are progressing on. In terms of individual roles on fights where some people are required to do something different (i.e Brackenspore Flamethrower duty) these will be discussed in preparation before pulling the boss. \n\n. Honesty and Communication: If you messed up on something during a boss fight, please bring the attention to the raid, or a whisper to a raid leader. We check logs after every raid, and we see what happens. If we know what's happening while we are working on it, we can assess the problem much faster, and as an entire team. You won't be isolated and laughed at. Raiding is a team experience. \n\n. Knowledge of your class: Not everybody is a world-first raider. We don't expect you to parse in the 100's on a day-to-day basis. We require that you know how to play your class, and that you regularly check up the current build for your class. Theorycrafting is also a great asset towards completely min-maxing your potential.\n\n. Trust in Us: We all share common goals, and we do our best to help everyone. Raiders have access to a stocked guild bank with materials ranging from all Enchanting mats, to raid food, etc. If we have a suggestion for someone, we're not trying to belittle what you're doing, but help you improve and understand how you can perform even better. This goes for all of us. \n\n. Patience: We'll be stuck on some bosses, every guild meets a roadblock. Wiping on a boss for a long time can be frustrating, but losing patience and interest will just result in making the fight harder. \n\n[u]Raid Times[/u] \n\nTuesday: 8:00pm - 11:00pm EST\nThursday: 8:00pm - 11:00pm EST\n\n[u]Benefits to joining Vagrants[/u]\n\n.

In this bio, I will give you all of my pros and cons, while listing my accolades and accomplishments throughout my 14ish years of playing MMO's. \n\nI am currently 18 years old, born in 98', started playing on a PC at 4 years old. It sounds crazy, but helped me become a very focused, social, and dependable person. In 2003, I saw trailers for World of Warcraft, and dreamed of playing it. At the time, I had started playing alongside my mom's Ex-Husband in Everquest. \n\nI grouped with, raided with, and quested with a guild of adults. I was the only exception of a \"Under 18\" player in the guild, due to my moms' Ex-Husband being a high-ranked officer in the guild. With the help of my step-dad, I was taught the basic fundamentals of PC gaming, MMO controls, and video game knowledge. By 6 years old I had begun building a new PC to compensate for the upcoming World of Warcraft release. \n\nWoW came out and I hopped on it like lightning. (Footnote : I didn't go to school 80% of the time due to a social disorder i.e : me not being able to associate myself and my likes of killing bosses in EQ to other 6 year olds and Legos.) I had made tons of adults friends in EQ who respected me for stepping up to the standards that an adult would have in a guild member. We founded a guild in WoW. Long story short, after a couple failed class attempts, I rolled with a warrior, and a future tank. \n\nBio over. \n\n- Everquest : Max Level Bard, Monk, and Druid. \n\n\n- World of Warcraft : [Vanilla] Prot Warrior until Naxx, Holy Priest.\n\n- [BC] Holy Priest, and Shadow Bolt SM Warlock.\n\n- [WotLK] Holy Priest, Holy Paladin\n\n- [Cata] Holy/Disc Priest\n\n- [MoP] Priest until SoO, quit afterwards.\n\n- [WoD] Priest/Shaman until HFC, took a break, came back to HFC. \nCURRENTLY MAINING A DEMON HUNTER\n\nThe reason I had stopped playing WoW in the past 2 expansions was due to being guildless. My old guild which was composed of all old friends and family were losing interest in the game once Cata was released. After clearing DS 100 times, they had decided to quit. And in MoP, we had lost 90% of our raiders.  \n\nMy WoW Accolades are spread across 3 accounts (1 Hacked, 1 Banned for having a friend play on it lol and my current one.)\n\nAccount #1 : Server 9th Onyxia, Server 7th Ragnaros, Server 4th Twin Emps, Server 3rd C'thun, Server 3rd KT, I don't have the actual number during BC, but everything we cleared in BC was Top 10 Server and Top 100 World up until SWP.\n\nAccount #2 Didn't track number records. Cleared everything in WotLK Normal and Heroic. Account got hacked last patch of WotLK.\n\nAccount #3 (Current Account) Cleared Everything Normal and Heroic except Dragon Soul, screw the Spine. \n\nPROS : \n\n- Expensive Gaming PC (No FPS problems.)\n\n- Great Internet (No Lag in Raids)\n\n- Very Patient\n\n- Willing to help others\n\n- Have led guilds before, have been an officer, and have successfully commanded guildmates through content. \n\nCons (In my opinion)\n\n- Humorous (If your guild is founded on feminism and PG-13 guidelines, please do not invite me to your guild.)\n\n- Adult language (I can filter myself need be, but would prefer not.)\n\nIf you have any more questions, please let me know. I would love to be interviewed, and would prefer an intercom over voice comms to get to know the personality of the people. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "wowguilds", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s8h3", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "2004-2016 Veteran LF Semi-Hardcore Raiding Guild", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wowguilds/comments/4zd5ca/20042016_veteran_lf_semihardcore_raiding_guild/"}, {"author": "YeahXynni", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1468653175, "domain": "self.csgotrade", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/csgotrade/comments/4t3jwt/h_fn_gut_knife_fade_w_offers/", "id": "4t3jwt", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/csgotrade/comments/4t3jwt/h_fn_gut_knife_fade_w_offers/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "V9-VzHpF24yeYjBqqhvomDpixbImDO6DChMp_oAxcvE", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/o5mi_YC4fjgiEEbLfZgXqCwXuOaDRuI9nY-qXF5bIvg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=b4ca46dca5e8f00227fa07eea5cbdca5", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/o5mi_YC4fjgiEEbLfZgXqCwXuOaDRuI9nY-qXF5bIvg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=17a9c81e6382366ec5d4cf667a91c773", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/o5mi_YC4fjgiEEbLfZgXqCwXuOaDRuI9nY-qXF5bIvg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=9f36c720647776f122b7c02edad71df2", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 512, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/o5mi_YC4fjgiEEbLfZgXqCwXuOaDRuI9nY-qXF5bIvg.jpg?s=8344623959ffb63b455e171ff1350338", "width": 512}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1472960655, "score": 1, "selftext": "Preferably 1:1 Trading, NO Underpaying, I'm open to negotiations.
