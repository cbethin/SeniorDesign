It's just I have some things I need to say and I feel more comfortable with random internet strangers knowing more about me than anyone I know irl. \n\nAt the time of writing this I'm 15 years old, 16 in three months. And I've recently been diagnosed with a severe depressive episode. I just wanna tell someone, I wanna tell someone the truth of what I feel like. I've been going through this for a few years now and to me this is my reality. I don't know any different to what I do now. I'm going through hell. During this time I've lost my mother to a surgery gone wrong and my girlfriend has also left me. I don't know why I'm saying this, I doubt you've been taking me seriously since I said my age. No-one bloody takes me seriously cause I'm just a kid and I don't know better. I've lost everything. I can't do anything. I can't tell my friends because they'll call the police and I can't tell my father or he'll send me off to a mental hospital. My girlfriend has abandoned me and left me to die and so have most of what I thought were my closest friends. I have more or less quit school entirely and so any chance I could have had at life has gone forever. I have nothing to live for. I'm waiting for the medication to give me enough strength to tie that cable around my neck. \n\nI'm sorry. I wouldn't have posted this if I wasn't so desperate. It's just I'm going to end it all. Finally I'll end it all and I can stop thinking. I'm not edgy or emo, I'm depressed. I hope you'll never understand what I'm going through because I wouldn't wish this on anyone. \n\nI guess that's my suicide note and all. I wish you'd taken me seriously.
