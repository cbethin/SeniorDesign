Swedish, and Japanese). I have eczema along with hairloss, which my dermatologist believes to be combination androgenic and alopecia areata. \n\nBackground: started experiencing scintillating scotoma in late Aug 2017. My eye doctor said everything looked fine to her,  possibly ocular migraine, but referred me to a neurologist of my choosing. He was a headache specialist with my local medical school. I had my appointment in mid September '17, to which he prescribed me an antidepressant (nortriptyline) to help prevent migraines, as well as sumatriptan and instructed me to take them when I started experiencing vision changes. He also ordered the MRI on 09/27 due to change in migraine pattern (I've had migraines since around 12 years of age, but never with auras). He got my results and called me on 9/29, indicating he thinks I may have a brain infection. I was on methotrexate for the past two years leading up to this, and was later instructed to discontinue taking methotrexate. I had a lumbar puncture that following Monday, and nothing showed up on any of the things they tested for. \n\nHe referred me to an autoimmune encephalitis neurologist. She ordered the following two MRIs. First visit, November 2017, she took in a lot of my history with symptoms, and wondered about MS, Beh\u00e7et's, and Sjogren's mainly (that I recall). Along with t. As noted in the results above, changes weren't really noticed in my brain since the last MRI.\n\nDuring my appointment in January, she put me through stress tests, an noted that my reflexes were overly sensitive, my speech is inconsistent, and one of my pupils (left) reacts differently to light. She ordered another MRI of my brain, and I believe this is when she ordered the MRI of my spine (that may have been November - I cannot recall). My neuro asked me if I'm more emotional during this appointment, which I noted that I have always been *too* emotional, perhaps. She said during this appointment that its not looking like MS, and asked if I had meningitis when I was a child. I didn't, but I was hospitalized at the age of 4 due to contacting salmonella poisoning from the local zoo. My neurologist wanted more info on this, wondering if the brain damage that's present is from the hospitalization. I didnt have a lot of info, but I do know that I had a difficult time with speech following the illness, and I was even placed into a remedial English class in elementary school because of the struggles I was having. My parents noticed my change in speech first, and told my pediatrician. My pediatrician thought I was fine. \n\nI have not experience visual symptoms since January (aside from one my episode in April). Beginning in December, I began noticing my legs, left arm, or lips would randomly go numb or have a tingling sensation. This continues through now. Sometimes I notice that I can see my pulse... what I mean by that is my vision pulsates with my heartbeat sometimes (this is rare). \n\nI am uncertain if I should still be worried about autoimmune processes affecting my CNS, but I am also curious if the area that the results says is damaged, impacts my ability to control my emotions, as well as my memory (and if so, how can I improve this? I find that I am lead by emotions and can never seem to bring myself back down when I do get in an emotional state - I've been working with therapists and psychiatrists for this, but I never seem to improve).My memory seems to be getting worse and worse. I forget A LOT of things, but I imagine this is also impacted by my use of weed - which brings me to another question - could marijuana be further worsening my symptoms? Also, if this was preexisting damage, what triggered my sudden onset of visual symptoms? \n\nAny insight would be appreciated!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskDocs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "subreddit_subscribers": 59455, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have questions about brain damage I have (backstory;this will be long)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8ybg4n/i_have_questions_about_brain_damage_i_have/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "KittenAdored", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_id": "t2_k21dzwb", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1531318176, "domain": "self.GamerPals", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerPals/comments/8xzw3y/27pcmst_looking_to_play_with_other_women_that/", "id": "8xzw3y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/GamerPals/comments/8xzw3y/27pcmst_looking_to_play_with_other_women_that/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1531318178, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Pretty selfexplanatory!
