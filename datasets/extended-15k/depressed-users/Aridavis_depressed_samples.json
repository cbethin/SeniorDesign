My joints ache and I constantly feel like I\u2019m fighting to stay awake when I can never really nap. Sleeping doesn\u2019t refresh me, and it\u2019s really hard to follow a conversation for more than 10 seconds.\n\nIt feels like there\u2019s someone still in here, a soul that is fighting against the machine that harbors it, who\u2019s battery life is running low and who\u2019s parts are starting to malfunction. \n\nTalking to people living normal lives makes you feel like a ghost. Nobody is really listening. Nobody really sees you for who you are because you don\u2019t really exist. Most of what you once were has become about you battling illness, and now you\u2019re just a shell of a person waiting to become whole again. You\u2019re not quite close to living, but you\u2019re definitely not dead. It becomes an in-between, a wait for a revival or to finally be put to rest. And it\u2019s incredibly isolating. \n\nWhen you\u2019re chronically ill eventually the though of death becomes an escape, and you think \u201cI could slip away so peacefully, it would be just like falling asleep for a very long time.\u201d Death occasionally feels like it would bring relief. Not much different from the world you\u2019re in now - colorless, just with far less suffering and effort. Because when you\u2019re ill, staying alive is one of the hardest things to do, and dying feels like it might just be easier. But then you realize that you\u2019ve been around for so long, existing day to day because you\u2019re too afraid to die.\n\nI have isolated myself from friends and family not because I don\u2019t care about them, but because I can\u2019t even remember to take a shower, let alone text them back. And when I do reach out, I don\u2019t want to tell them about my day because all I did was linger in a resentful state about my disease and struggle to get anything productive done. \n\nI want to talk to someone that won\u2019t tell me to just \u201ctry harder\u201d, but here I am, with few options because the wait for therapy is too long and a sooner session is too expensive.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to remain alive though. Primarily because I\u2019m far too afraid to take my own life, and also, because the memories of how vibrant I used to be fuel me to do whatever I can to go back there. To when things were normal. Hope is humanity\u2019s best survival instinct.\n\nHave a good day people.

Would like to know some other situations that might crop up in a game where dribbling will be needed, if you guys want to give it a go it's\n\nC024-E981-5801-7C44\n\nI'm sure there's other ones out there that are 9x better than mine, link if any come to mind, I haven't done the research. Otherwise tips would be super helpful!! I always (especially in 1v1) just end up driving the ball straight up to the opponent and basically hand it to them like free candy. Also, defending against dribblers, any tips? Always seems like a 50/50 when they know what they're doing. If you go left, they'll go right and vice versa. I have heard that it's always best to take high ground.\n\nJust don't have the ball control to juke people yet, or the prediction, I guess. But that's what I'm here for\n\n thanks Reddit :D\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "RocketLeague", "subreddit_id": "t5_30cz1", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Dribbling training", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/6h97o0/dribbling_training/", "view_count": null}, {"author": "Aridavis", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1393096888, "domain": "youtube.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1yn5id/things_i_dont_understand_sharing_my_crazy_ideas/", "id": "1yn5id", "is_self": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "Ariel Davis", "author_url": "http://www.youtube.com/user/1arieldavis", "description": "Hey everyone!
