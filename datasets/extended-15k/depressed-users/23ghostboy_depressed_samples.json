I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 and I've struggled talking about my problems since. I've come along way thanks to friends opening up and I'm better for it. My problem is when I open up to my partner of 4 years about something weighing on me, she will listen to and then immidiatly expect me to get over it. This will then lead to noticeable frustration on her part and an eventual fight where I'm told to stop letting things bring me down. I know it's hard to gauge the situation based on a paragrah but I'm unsure how to deal with this any more.
