Only five days into my depressive episode I have had some of the worst self harm and suicidal thoughts. For the first time I believed them. I cry everyday, have had two \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do anymore\u201d conversations with my boyfriend, and it\u2019s killing him. I exist and smile for brief moments just to fall back down. He\u2019s convinced my ex broke me, reinforced I was worthless, and now I am living the result of that. Maybe he\u2019s right. \n\nI turn 20 in 10 days and I don\u2019t even want to make it. On my birthday I have therapy. The day after I have my first psychiatrist appointment. Medication is on the table. But do I even want help anymore. I hate my job, I am a burden, I am a fuck up. And I don\u2019t know how soon I will hit rock bottom. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I want to die. Death terrifies me. But I can\u2019t get up anymore and fake this. For the first time  I couldn\u2019t get out of bed to go to class. I know for some that\u2019s everyday, a cliche question in every depression medication commercial, but that is something on the worst days I used to do. My passion crept through the numbness long enough to get me driving and in a classroom seat. But I think it finally died.

I have always had anxiety but never too bad. But in 11th grade I began losing friends, my best friend to her new boyfriend, my closer friends to drama and their belief that I was annoying and boring. But I had a gf, so it had to be okay? My past girlfriend was hospitalized for anorexia, and we rarely saw each other or talked for months. I developed daily panic attacks and my hands would turn blue from stress. I went to the ER twice but after she became an outpatient I got better. But slowly we drifted due to her depression. And so began my current issues. By the end of our first year together she ignored me for days or weeks and I felt alone with her. So I ended it. (There was a lot to this and I put up with it five months too long) After this I began my last semester of high school with zero friends, eating lunch with a teacher everyday because I couldn't face the cafeteria. I occasionally hung out with new friends, but they were shallow and short lived. By April I couldn't go to school events because I would simply sit alone and then cry in the bathroom. So I unscrewed a blade and started cutting. I cut all down my arm for weeks till my parents saw. Some threatening and guilt tripping conversations later, I was in a therapist office. I hated it and felt unproductive, so I cancelled and never went back. I moved my cutting down to my thigh and my parents stopped asking. Prom came, me in a strapless dress, I spent a good portion lying about the cuts down my arm, and the other half crying in a bathroom and sitting on the balcony wishing I wasn't afraid of heights. My senior prom was one of the worst nights of my life. I passed so many people who knew my name but never were close enough to actually care. I spent the rest of the year just existing, I don't remember much. I went a few weeks without cutting but relapsed. Summer was worse. Because I had nothing but a job I hate and my isolation. Then came a mistake. I was losing it. Spending days feeling depressed and lifeless with small burst of my old self before the cycle began again. So recklessly I slept with my ex gf's current bf. They aren't entirely exclusive but regardless I felt like a shameful slut. (Rationally I am not, but that't just my mind). It was never properly resolved, but because life is ironic, my ex and her bf are my only \"friends\". We don't really habg our and rather just text. Neither of them provide true emotional support or joy in my life. There's my little history. But here is my mindset: I am never good enough. I am annoying and a pain, I don't deserve friends. My art will never provide success, regardless of my effort. I will judge you in shallow ways on your appearance. I will avoid you because your not perfect. And I do this because I hate myself. I don't tell people my thoughts in them. People actually consider me that one sweet, innocent friend. But I tell myself what I feel, every moment of every day. I am isolated with the worst person in my life, myself. In the past, a few people have lifted me up, but I always rely on that to prevent myself from falling too low. I started college today and I made no friends, and feel unpassionate about classes I have wanted for years. If this keeps up, my self harming will not stop.
