I was buying butt plugs and paddles, and rope. I paid women to humiliate me. I bought cartoon porn and videos. I was VERY deep into the humiliation fetish. \n\nMy therapist said it was a good thing that I quit. And I finally feel sort of free of my fetish.

It was so stupid and unhealthy. \n\nI feel like a freak. I really fucked up. I fucked up my life with these fetishes.\n\nMy therapist doesn't know any submissive men who are happy.

And I called my psychiatrist and she said \"Oh that's not withdrawal, that's most likely the depression coming back\"\n\nI only lasted a little over a week and then went back on my medications.

I'm 24 and first started smoking around age 22. I used weed to cope and \"feel\" better. It was just fun for me.\n\nI was in college and had NO money. On the weekends I would drive home and go and donate plasma and the plasma center. I donated plasma about 8 times or so, maybe more. Just so I could buy more weed.\n\nAll the while, I was smoking at my parent's house. They knew I smoked and HATED it. They just put with it. I was so ashamed of myself. I had no where else to smoke, so I just went outside and smoked in the shed. They told me to stop and pleaded with me stop, but I just kept buying more pot and smoking. It's really disgusting how I smoked at my parent's house and I just feel disgusted over the whole situation. It's honestly pathetic. \n\nIt was really fucked up and I'm ashamed of myself for how much pain I caused my mother and father. Mostly my mother.\n\nAnd then I graduated from college. I was given money. And I pretty much spent all that money on weed and alcohol. It was around $400 or so.\n\nI'm ashamed of how bad I let it get. I thought it was harmless.\n\nI went to Texas with my family for a month, and that's pretty much how I got sober. I was also given money for working out on the truck shop. And you know what I did? I spent that money on more drugs when I came back.\n\nI literally spent every single dollar I had on drugs.\n\nEventually, I just decided it was the wrong thing to do. So I flushed all my weed down the toilet. I then bought another bag, smoked a little, and then flushed it down the toilet again. I remember looking at this bag of weed in my hand and decided it was the wrong thing to do, so I flushed it all down the toilet. \n\nI still sometimes think about buying more pot. I have the money now. But I am choosing not to because it just isn't healthy for my state of mind right now.\n\nHowever, I still smoke with friends sometimes. Like, I would go to my best friend's house and his girlfriend would let me his her vape pen sometimes. But that's about it.\n\nI'm disgusted and ashamed of how bad I let pot consume my life. I just used it to cope and escape my shitty reality.\n\nI feel horrible for the pain I put my parents through, especially my mother. I really hurt her with this stuff. \n\nI stopped buying weed. I don't want to buy more weed. I could easily hit up my dealer and buy an 8th, but I'm not going to because smoking alone is NOT healthy or will do me anything good.\n\nMy parents still love me. But god, I feel so fucked up what I was doing. I even smoked in my dorm with my roommate for an entire semester and never got caught. I did a lot of shitty things with weed.\n\nI even got high and drove. Even went on the highway when I probably shouldn't have, but I did. \n\nPot for me, is a really fucked up thing. I don't think there is anything positive about it....maybe it makes you creative? I used to draw a lot when high. That was my excuse for getting high, it helped me make better art. I would smoke and then draw in my sketchbook.\n\nI don't think I've ever apologized to my parents about my pot usage. I just stopped and they know I stopped and I just leave it at that. Thing is, I still smoke...just with friends, that's my one rule. \n\nI just feel horrible about the whole thing. I mean, I donated plasma just so I could buy more drugs. How the fuck do I deal with something like that? I've been going to therapy for other issues, never really did talk about the pot....because I don't really do it anymore.\n\nMy time with my therapist is limited, so I'd rather talk about other fucked up things I'm dealing with. Does it sound like I need to talk about this pot usage I had in the past? Or should I just learn from it and move on. I don't really think about it, because what's the point? Yeah, I really fucked up, but that is the past and I can learn from it and change for the better. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "leaves", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9i3", "subreddit_subscribers": 73343, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I used to donate plasma just so I could buy more weed", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9v3eih/i_used_to_donate_plasma_just_so_i_could_buy_more/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "gothboygucci", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "week4", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": "29 Days", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_102yrli9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541550790, "domain": "self.NoFap", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9uu8wn/i_masturbated_at_my_grandmothers_house/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9uu8wn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/NoFap/comments/9uu8wn/i_masturbated_at_my_grandmothers_house/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1541550791, "score": 1, "selftext": "During the summer I was really fucked up on porn.

I've been with the same therapist for years.\n\nEver since I was 12, I was put on antidepressants. Various drugs over the years. I'm now hooked on them. My parents regret ever starting me on them in the first place, but they were hopeless and just wanted me to feel better.\n\nCurrently on Risperidone, 2mg, and Mirtazapine 15mg. I got off Duioxetine about 6 months ago. I tried getting off Risperidone by weaning by going from 2mg down to 1mg, and I only lasted a little over a week. It was just too painful and I thought I was going insane.\n\nI'm constantly miserable and sad. I just feel really lonely. I feel fucked up all the time because of these medications. My therapist says I need them. And that the risperidone helps me clear my head and helps me focus.\n\nI think about suicide everyday. This morning I woke up thinking about buying rope at Home Depot and hanging myself. I think about hanging myself a lot, that or getting hit by a car.\n\nIt's fucked up. I don't want to die but I do. I don't want to hurt my family. I'm so ashamed of myself.\n\nI call the suicide hotline just about every month or every week it seems like now. I just feel so hateful of myself. I used to have some fucked up humiliation fetishes that really fucked up my life. I used to masturbate everyday to humiliation porn. Just some of the lowest stuff imaginable. It made me feel like shit and I got off on that. I was masturbating so much instead of making friends or girlfriends in high school in college. I've then stopped masturbating and it's been two months away from porn, and I still feel like shit.\n\nI'm ashamed of myself. Back in high school I used to touch women inappropriately on buses and crowded hallways. I didn't know what the fuck I was thinking. I just did it because it was fun I guess. I've since stopped. My sister saw me touching one time and she read my diary saying I hate women. I don't even have a relationship with my sister. The fucked up thing is I don't know what age I stopped. Maybe when I was a junior or something. I'm ashamed I did that. I have no desire to touch women anymore like that and it's been years since the last time I did that.\n\nI just feel fucked up. I hate myself. I think about suicide and I'm just in a lot of pain.\n\nAnd it's not like I can really talk about this stuff. My best friend says I don't need therapy or pills and thinks I'm normal. And yet all of these doctors are saying I'm not ready to come off the pills and that I need this stuff.\n\nI'm just so sad and angry and upset. My sister graduated college the same year as me and moved all the way to Cali with her boyfriend. And yet here I am miserable, hooked on pills and therapy, and still living with my parents. I'm just so ashamed of myself and miserable.\n\nAnd I have a tough relationship with my parents. I can't even look them in the eye, it's just so uncomfortable. My mom knows I used to touch women. And I even talked to her about that. And she keeps telling me to just move on and stop living in the past. She also knows of my fetishes because she found adult diapers and panties in my room growing up. I quit the fetish two months ago because it was causing me so much pain.\n\nI just feel so disgusted with myself.\n\nI'm ashamed of myself. And I'm in a lot of pain. I just don't know how I'm ever going to get better. I'm 24 and thought this depression would be gone by now. But it only seems to be getting worse.\n\nThe fucked up thing is I made my own mother cry at my graduation. The best day of my life and I fucked it up. She came to give me a hug and kiss, and I just grabbed her face and squeezed it and pushed her away. I was horrified by her crying. And no matter how much I apologize, I just feel like shit.\n\nI just hate myself so much. I call the suicide hotline and cry and cry, but I just can't seem to make this pain stop.\n\nI feel horrible all the time. Things just seem so fucking dark and scary. And I don't know how it will get better.\n\nI'm trying to apply to grad school and become certified to become an art teacher. But I don't know if I will even get accepted.\n\nI just want to die, just to make this pain stop. I want to get off the meds, but my therapist says I need them. And I don't even know what life is like without medication.\n\nFuck, if I'm feeling this fucked up now, imagine what life would be like without the meds. I sometimes wonder if I would be happier without them. But maybe I do need them, I really don't know.\n\nI just feel so horrible. They keep saying this will pass and things will get better, but it just doesn't feel like it. Things feel so fucked up right now and I just want to die.\n\nI mean, what's the point of living if you're always miserable and hooked on expensive medications. My parents and friends want me to get off this stuff, but I don't know if I can.\n\nI mean, I went from 2mg down to 1mg, and it was the worse hell of my life. Did I just need to go slower or something? Yet my therapist says I need to be on this shit because it helps me focus.\n\nI just hate myself. I'm sick of who I am. My cousin tells me to sculpt myself into a great person. And says I can redeem myself and become great.\n\nBut I just don't see that ever happening. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse and things are just getting worse and worse.\n\nI don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I just see nothing but pain and more misery.\n\nI can't even look at my parent's faces without feeling uncomfortable.\n\nHow is this going to get better?

I remember wearing multiple pairs of tighty whities to create a diaper. All these shameful things I did growing up, feel like trauma. I feel traumatized by what I did to myself.\n\nI just feel sick to my stomach thinking of this stuff. It really haunts me that I did all of these shameful things to myself. I\u2019m embarrassed by myself. And I remember cumming all over a canvas in my room and calling it at one time, and my mother finding it and being disgusted. I was a fucked up kid growing up.\n\nMy relationship with my mother is strained. It\u2019s hard to look her in the eye with her knowing all of these horrible things about me. She still loves me no matter what, and I just feel so ashamed of myself that I just want to die.\n\nI\u2019m just so fucking ashamed of myself for growing up like this. I thought I could just accept this as a simple fetish. But it just doesn\u2019t feel like it.

I\u2019m just so sick of it I just want to stop.\n\nEveryone always says I look so sad or upset. At work, I was told by multiple people that I look sad, upset, miserable and bored. My coworker asked me why I look so sad and upset and asked what was wrong. My manager said he was worried about me.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I can tell people why I\u2019m depressed. I\u2019m depressed because I have a fetish that ruined a lot of my life. I just can\u2019t talk to people about it. I feel alone in the regard.\n\nI feel like my diaper/crossdressing humiliation fetish caused the majority of my depression. I felt alone. I felt like a freak. I grew up doing these horrible and embarrassing things to myself, I feel so fucked up and warped from the damage I did.\n\nHow do I become comfortable with my family? Yeah, I go with my parents to the movies, but I still feel\u2026ashamed of what they know about me? I just feel upset they know something I don\u2019t want them to know? They still love me, but\u2026.I have a hard time loving them back and it breaks my heart\u2026and I feel it\u2019s all because of this stupid fetish.\n\nWhy did I grow up wanting to humiliate myself so badly? What\u2019s the reason for that?\n\nAbout two months ago I decided I had enough. I was just sick of everything and wanted to change. So I threw away all my diapers, dresses, panties, dildos, bras, and rubber PVC suits into the trash. I just had enough. I stopped masturbating for two months now and I just never want to return to that darkness.\n\nI hate how people say you should love yourself and accept yourself for what you like. Life is short, so enjoy yourself and accept your fetishes. But that's not who I want to be. I don't want to grow up any longer with these fetishes holding me back in life.\n\nThe worst part about this is my family knows. My sister found all my diapers and was disgusted and threw them in the trash. I meekly just fished them out of the trash and put them back in the box and hid them in the basement.\n\nI just wish I never had this fetish since it caused me so much self hate and loathing. No woman is going to enjoy humiliating her SO in diapers and love them. Okay, sure...maybe there will be someone out there, but it's just an unrealistic fantasy.\n\nI also HEAVILY watched humiliation porn. I watched diaper porn just about everyday. I looked at cartoons and hentai depicting diaper humiliation. I read erotica and comics involving this fetish. I even spent money on porn videos and also dominatrixes. I've just been through a lot. I got very DEEP into this fetish.\n\nI just...wanted to stop indulging in this stupid fetish which does nothing good for me. If it was acceptable, I wouldn't be feeling so depressed and suicidal over it. Yeah, I feel suicidal over a fucking diaper fetish, isn't that insane?\n\nJust look at my post history and see how fucked up I am. I'm miserable, lonely, and depressed. I only have one friend and he has NO idea about all of this fetish. I don't want him to ever know because he would look at me differently. Maybe in the future years from now, I can just say \"Hey I used to have a fetish for humiliation, but I changed my way of thinking and don't get into that stuff anymore\"\n\nI just want to be happy.

I started dressing like a girl and wearing diapers and tying myself up. This went on for years and years.\n\nThen around when I was a teenager, I started watching humiliation porn. I really got into watching adult women forced into diapers and spanked. I got very, very deep into the fetish. I spent money on porn videos and cartoon comics. I looked at cartoon diaper porn and diaper hentai. I got into erotica and read stories about diaper humiliation written by old men in their 50s. I even paid women to humiliate me.\n\nI've never had a girlfriend and I'm still a virgin at age 24.\n\nGrowing up, I had no friends really. Nobody really liked me and I was picked on and teased. My therapist said it was because of my fetish. He said it was a big secret and that I kept quiet and shy because I didn't want anyone to know.\n\nThis fetish caused me a lot of pain and depression. I masturbated every single day to fantasies of being forced into diapers. I'm just so ashamed of myself of how far I let this fetish go on. What sucks is my parents and sister know, and it's hard dealing with them because they know. I'm just so ashamed and embarrassed my family knows this dark secret of mine, I don't even have a relationship with my sister. We just aren't friends.\n\nI HATE my fetish. I wanted to stop. I tried quitting in the past, but I just could never do it. I told my therapist I just wanted to accept it as a harmless fetish and that it wasn't a big deal. But that isn't the truth, this is a very big deal. And this fetish has caused me a lot of problems.\n\nI had a lot of issues growing up, and I just used porn and diaper fantasies to escape from reality. I used diapers and humiliation as an escape or something. Even my therapist doesn't know how or why the fetish happened.\n\nI'm going through a very extreme depression. And it's hard talking to people about it because I just can't tell them \"Oh I'm depressed because I'm dealing with a humiliation fetish involving diapers\" It's  like, one of the most fucked up fetishes to have.\n\nI thought I could just accept this and think of it as okay and not an issue, but it is an issue. I want to stop. My therapist says I can stop. And that I can change my way of thinking about it realizing I don't want to go back to that fetish. I don't HAVE to be this way. This is NOT who I want to be.\n\nI've been ashamed of myself all my life. And I feel like this fetish was a big part of my depression. Because it was such a big secret I hid from others. It's so painful, and shameful and I just can't talk about it with anyone except my therapist.\n\nI hate how people say that you should just accept a fetish. I don't buy that anymore. My therapist said I just learned this fetish through masturbating.\n\nI'm just going through a lot right now. I stopped masturbating on October 8th. I threw away all my diapers and dresses, because I was just so sick and ashamed of how I got off on this garbage.\n\nI really fucked up my life by masturbating so often. Every fucking family vacation I was alone masturbating or watching diaper porn on my phone.  I'm just so ashamed and angry at myself for doing this kind of shit for so long.\n\nMy entire body is screaming at me to masturbate. My body wants me to go back to diapers and humiliation very badly. It's painful and pathetic. I can't believe I am going through this kind of shit. I've even felt suicidal about this stuff, which is just so fucking stupid.\n\nI just want to quit. And I did. I actually quit two months ago, but got drunk and high one night with friends and masturbated when I went to sleep. I was so fucked up, that I masturbated in my best friend's basement to the idea of humiliation. I'm ashamed of myself.\n\nI've been going through a lot of self hate. I don't even know if I can quit this fetish. I mean, to quit you just kind of stop. But my god, my desires for humiliation are just so fucking extreme, I can't stop thinking about it. All I want to do is just masturbate more than anything, but I'm not going to.\n\nI mean, is there hope? Can I recover from this horrible fetish? Can these desires go away if I just stop masturbating? If I stay away from porn and the fetishes, will they eventually fade away. I've been masturbating for so fucking long, I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I feel so warped and damaged from these fetishes that ran my life.\n\nI'm just so depressed and angry and ashamed of myself. I feel so pathetic for having this fetish ruin my life and cause me to have zero friends or girlfriends. It's kept me from having meaningful relationships. All it has done is caused me a lot of pain, so why the fuck would I want to go back to that pain? \n\nI'm just going through a lot and if any of you have advice, it would help, thanks.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "NoFap", "subreddit_id": "t5_2skrn", "subreddit_subscribers": 367815, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I just feel really fucked up and need advice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9qttsg/i_just_feel_really_fucked_up_and_need_advice/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "gothboygucci", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_102yrli9", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539843364, "domain": "self.AskMen", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9p6ma8/at_what_age_is_it_weird_to_still_be_a_virgin/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9p6ma8", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AskMen/comments/9p6ma8/at_what_age_is_it_weird_to_still_be_a_virgin/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539843365, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskMen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "subreddit_subscribers": 745533, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "At what age is it weird to still be a virgin?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9p6ma8/at_what_age_is_it_weird_to_still_be_a_virgin/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "gothboygucci", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_102yrli9", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539841627, "domain": "self.NoFap", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9p6g2d/anybody_hone_their_fetishes_and_develop_them_over/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9p6g2d", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/NoFap/comments/9p6g2d/anybody_hone_their_fetishes_and_develop_them_over/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1539841628, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ever since I was about six years old, I had a desire for diapers. Eventually, that desire turned solely into a desire for humiliation. And one day when I was eleven, I just started crossdressing all of a sudden. Why the fuck did I wear a skirt at that age, I have no idea. There was this old Tom and Jerry cartoon where Tom was forced into diapers and humiliated. It was called Baby Puss, it's on youtube. When I saw that, it was everything I've always wanted.\n\nWhen I was 13, I started watching humiliation porn. Everything that involved humiliation. I got into diapers, bondage, spankings, and cross-dressing.\n\nThis fetish went on and on for years. Constant masturbating every single morning and night. I've been to Costa Rica and China with family, and alone in my room I would masturbate to fantasies of humiliation.\n\nI watched tons and tons of this kind of humiliation diaper porn. I even paid money for it. I went to Deviantart and masturbated to cartoons of diaper porn. I read erotica of this fetish. I got pretty deep into this fetish.\n\nWhat's painful is that my parents know I like this stuff. They caught my porn history. My sister found my stash of adult diapers with baby patterns and brought it upstairs in front of my parents and threw it all in the trash. My mother found diapers in my room hidden under my bed. I was just so clumsy and foolish with this fetish. I should have been more careful, but I just wasn't paying attention. It really hurts that they know. My parents don't bring it up and neither does my sister. My mother told her to never tell anyone. But god damn, it really hurts and I feel so ashamed of myself.\n\nThis fetish pretty much ruined my life. It kept me from making friends. I've never had a girlfriend or had sex. My therapist says that this was because I had a big secret and I was shy and quiet because I didn't want anyone to know about my fetish.\n\nI always thought \"Hey a lot of people have this fetish, it's okay, I will just find a woman on Fetlife who will enjoy it\" But that is a very unrealistic way of thinking. Humiliation is a big deal breaker for a lot of women. Women want a strong and confident man, not someone who masturbates in diapers. I look very sad all the time and it's because I have this giant secret.\n\nI carry a lot of self-hate, shame, and depression. I've thought about suicide countless times.\n\nI tried quitting in the past, but never succeeded. But recently, I just decided that I was sick of the fetish. I threw all my diapers and panties away and just stopped masturbating. \n\nI just fucked up my life pretty bad with these fetishes and porn. I feel so ashamed of myself. I really hate myself for letting this desire for humiliation get this far. \n\nI just want to quit. And I guess I did. I sometimes have dreams of myself masturbating in diapers. I still have thoughts that pop up. But I think this time, I will be able to stay away from the fetish.\n\nIf anyone has advice, it would help. I'm 24.

She said it was a bad idea and recommended being medicated for life because it works.\n\nEver since Sept 28th, when I lowered that dose, I've been going through an absolute hell. I have trouble sleeping. Always sweating. I feel vibrations and tingly feelings which are very unpleasant throughout the day and night, especially when I sleep.\n\nI've been feeling a very massive depression that just hurts. I feel like I'm in a lot of pain. Everything hurts. Nothing makes me happy. Music doesn't sound the same. Everything just hurts.\n\nI asked my psychiatrist and she said \"Oh I don't think it's withdrawal, it's probably the depression coming back and you should go back on 2mg\"\n\nI'm just sick of all these drugs. I just want to be free and normal and away from these horrible drugs. I honestly don't think I need it. My therapist has said that Risperidone has helped me in the past to focus, not sure what he means by that. He said it helped with my erractic thinking and delusional thoughts I used to have when I was younger. And yeah, I was a fucked up kid growing up, but I'm 24 now and know better now and don't think I need it anymore.\n\nI feel like I'm slipping and losing touch. Things just feel weird and off. Nothing feels good. I'm in a lot of pain.\n\nIs this really just withdrawal and my psychiatrist is lying to me? She said she really didn't think it was withdrawal, but still. I feel in my heart that it's withdrawal. She said 2mg to 1mg, wasn't that big of a change really. She didn't think it was withdrawal.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm just in a lot of pain. Will vaping CBD help in any way? Will drinking kratom at night help in any way? Will taking CBD oil help in any way? I still have mirtazapine in my system, in about 9 days can I start taking 50mg of 5HTP, will that help in anyway?\n\nI've been running every day. I've been drinking kale smoothies. But everything just seems so dark and painful that I could just start crying from the pain.\n\nI went to the pharmacy, and they said there was nothing they could do.\n\nAnd my psychiatrist doesn't think CBD does anything. I don't know if it does anything either really, except maybe help me fall asleep.\n\nI've been on 2mg of risperidone for years. Is this just withdrawal that I'm going through? Is this just part of the process of getting off these drugs?\n\nI'm scared of going forward. The pain just keeps getting worse and worse each day. I have no energy. I can't focus. I just can't do anything. And I go to work tomorrow and I'm scared because of how painful it will be. I know I need to keep working, but still.\n\nThings are just really fucked up right now. My friends and family think I'm normal and don't need this medication. They all support me in getting off this stuff. My parents wish they never started me on this medication, it's my dad's biggest regret in life.\n\nBut just how long is this pain going to last? I feel a deep pain within me that just HURTS. I feel so uncomfortable and everything is painful and unenjoyable. Nothing makes me feel good at all.\n\nCan smoking weed help with the withdrawals or will that make things worse?\n\nI feel like I'm going through depersonalization. Things just feel off and different. I'm really scared right now. Do I even need this stuff? I don't know until I get off it.\n\nIf you have any advice, please tell me. I just want to get off this medication as soon as possible. I was going to see my psychiatrist on the 23rd of October, and then she will lower the dose again, and then after that I guess I will be drug-free perhaps?\n\nI'm in so much pain that I just want to cry. I can't even feel emotions really, I don't feel happy or excited. Nothing makes me happy anymore.\n\nI feel so miserable and fucked up from this medication.

I was on 15mg of mirtazapine and she said I could stop taking it. She then lowered the dose of 2mg down to 1mg of risperidone. She said it was a bad idea and recommended being medicated for life because it works.\n\nEver since Sept 28th, when I lowered that dose, I've been going through an absolute hell. I have trouble sleeping. Always sweating. I feel vibrations and tingly feelings which are very unpleasant throughout the day and night, especially when I sleep.\n\nI've been feeling a very massive depression that just hurts. I feel like I'm in a lot of pain. Everything hurts. Nothing makes me happy. Music doesn't sound the same. Everything just hurts.\n\nI asked my psychiatrist and she said \"Oh I don't think it's withdrawal, it's probably the depression coming back and you should go back on 2mg\"\n\nI'm just sick of all these drugs. I just want to be free and normal and away from these horrible drugs. I honestly don't think I need it. My therapist has said that Risperidone has helped me in the past to focus, not sure what he means by that.\n\nI feel like I'm slipping and losing touch. Things just feel weird and off. Nothing feels good. I'm in a lot of pain.\n\nIs this really just withdrawal and my psychiatrist is lying to me? She said she really didn't think it was withdrawal, but still. I feel in my heart that it's withdrawal. She said 2mg to 1mg, wasn't that big of a change really. She didn't think it was withdrawal.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm just in a lot of pain. Will vaping CBD help in any way? Will drinking kratom at night help in any way? Will taking CBD oil help in any way? I still have mirtazapine in my system, in about 9 days can I start taking 50mg of 5HTP, will that help in anyway?\n\nI've been running every day. I've been drinking kale smoothies. But everything just seems so dark and painful that I could just start crying from the pain.\n\nI went to the pharmacy, and they said there was nothing they could do.\n\nAnd my psychiatrist doesn't think CBD does anything. I don't know if it does anything either really, except maybe help me fall asleep.\n\nI've been on 2mg of risperidone for years. Is this just withdrawal that I'm going through? Is this just part of the process of getting off these drugs?\n\nI'm scared of going forward. The pain just keeps getting worse and worse each day. I have no energy. I can't focus. I just can't do anything. And I go to work tomorrow and I'm scared because of how painful it will be. I know I need to keep working, but still.\n\nThings are just really fucked up right now. My friends and family think I'm normal and don't need this medication. They all support me in getting off this stuff. My parents wish they never started me on this medication, it's my dad's biggest regret in life.\n\nBut just how long is this pain going to last? I feel a deep pain within me that just HURTS. I feel so uncomfortable and everything is painful and unenjoyable. Nothing makes me feel good at all.\n\nCan smoking weed help with the withdrawals or will that make things worse?\n\nI feel like I'm going through depersonalization. Things just feel off and different. I'm really scared right now.\n\nIf you have any advice, please tell me. I just want to get off this medication as soon as possible. I was going to see my psychiatrist on the 23rd of October, and then she will lower the dose again, and then after that I guess I will be drug-free perhaps?\n\nI'm in so much pain that I just want to cry. I can't even feel emotions really, I don't feel happy or excited. Nothing makes me happy anymore. \n\nI feel so miserable and fucked up from this medication. I just want to get off this stuff as soon as possible. Am I going through withdrawal or is it just the depression coming back?

I feel like doctors over prescribe and enough is enough. I want to clear my head and be free of these horrible drugs that cause nothing but pain and weight gain. I was diagnosed with major depression and psychotic symptoms? Delusions I guess. I've gained so much weight and no matter how much I go running, I still am chubby. I just want my brain to rewire itself and get back to normal. My friends and family think I'm normal and want me to get off of these horrible drugs.\n\nWith guidance from my psychiatrist, I went from 2mg of risperidone to 1mg of risperidone.\n\nEver since I did that, I've been feeling pretty fucking bad. I called my psychiatrist and asked if it was withdrawal. She didn't think it was and just said that it was probably the depression coming back and recommended going back to 2mg of risperidone.\n\nI just want to ride this pain out. I'm not going back to 2mg, I don't think I need it. I feel these drugs do more harm than good in the long run. She recommended being medicated for life which is just ridiculous. \n\nSo yeah, I've been feeling pretty bad ever since Sept 28th when I went down a dose. Also the bottle says to take it in the morning, is it okay to take it at night or do I have to follow what the bottle says? My last dose always used to be at night and this bottle just says to take it during the day, which just makes me so sleepy.\n\nIs it possible to be going through withdrawal in just a week? Or is this just the \"depression\" coming back? It feels like my doctors just want me to be medicated forever, which I don't think is realistic and is very dangerous.\n\nI just feel like enough is enough. These drugs are fucking up my life. My parents wish I was never put on them in the first place. I don't want to continue with this drug and that drug and taking pills everyday, that just isn't a way to live life. I just want to be drug free and clear and have my brain rewire itself back to a clear state of being.\n\nOr am I being an idiot and have to take pills for the rest of my life because I'm stupid and have a chemical imbalance and I need drugs in order to feel normal or happy? I mean, how do I know if I need these drugs or not? When you take pills like this for so long, you're definitely going to feel fucked up coming off them, right? Is what I'm going through normal?\n\nOr should I just follow what my doctors say and just listen to what they think I need just so I can be drugged up and somewhat apart of society? \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 394300, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anybody have experience coming off Risperidone?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9msr7s/anybody_have_experience_coming_off_risperidone/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "gothboygucci", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_102yrli9", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539110109, "domain": "self.Instagram", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/9mrrik/using_the_insta_clean_app_to_mass_unfollow_people/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9mrrik", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Instagram/comments/9mrrik/using_the_insta_clean_app_to_mass_unfollow_people/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539110111, "score": 1, "selftext": "I stupidly followed over 3000 people and just wanted to unfollow them as quickly as possible.\n\nI got the insta cleaner app and started unfollowing people, 50 at a time.\n\nEventually I got blocked and couldn't unfollow people anymore.\n\nI don't know how long this block will last.

We are really close and hang out just about every week.\n\nRecently, I decided to get off my antipsychotic medication. My friends and family have supported me and said I was making the right decision. \n\nI then started to go through withdrawal, and things have been really hard.\n\nMy friend knows what I'm going through. On Friday, we went out to a bar. I was a bit high from smoking weed earlier and got really drunk. I then started talking really loudly about something EXTREMELY inappropriate. It was like the worst thing I could ever talk about, and here I was, blabbing about my secret problem loudly in a bar. I remember him saying \"Yo you should keep that lowkey\" or something like he was telling me not to talk about it. I kept asking him \"Should I kill myself for what I did\" And he said \"No, quit asking me that\" God yeah, I was super drunk and not in a really good place to be talking like that. I feel so cringy that I asked him that. I fucked up.\n\nWe then went back to his place and I slept in his basement because I was too drunk to drive. I also smoked more weed with his girlfriend and he went straight to bed leaving us alone to talk and smoke.\n\nMy withdrawal symptoms were getting worse and I felt like things were getting more fucked up. \n\nFriends are supposed to listen to your problems, right? Friends are supposed to give you advice when you have an issue or problem, right? I have very serious issues and I'm afraid I'm bothering my friend with them and causing him stress.\n\nOn Saturday, I gave him a phone call and it went straight to voicemail, I left him a message saying \"Hey Eric, I just wanted to apologize for what happened at the bar, I shouldn't have said that and I don't know what I was thinking and I was speaking too loudly,\"\n\nI didn't hear back from him. Then Sunday happens, I call him on Sunday and it goes straight to voicemail, this time I didn't leave a message. I guess I just needed advice from him or something. I'm going through the worst withdrawal in my life and I need him now more than ever. Am I relying on him too much? Am I being too needy? Am I being a bad friend by asking him to help and listen to my problems? I text his girlfriend asking if he was mad at me. And she said \"No, he would tell you up front if he was mad\" \n\nThen Monday happens. I call him again, and it goes straight to voicemail AGAIN. He never got back to me, no text or call. \n\nI then text his girlfriend again asking....well, this is what I asked \n\n\"Hey don't tell Eric I said this. I called him today at 7:42. He didn't pick up.\n\nIs everything okay with him and I? I'm through a lot right now. I feel like I am pushing away with my issues and he doesn't want to talk to me. I'm scared of losing his friendship. \n\nDid he say anything about me? Should I just leave him alone for a while? I'm just in a really dark place right now and wanted to talk to him. Am I asking too much? Did I piss him off? Am I being a bad friend?\"\n\nShe never responded. Usually, she responds right away, but this time she didn't say anything.\n\nI'm freaking out. I'm afraid I fucked up this friendship and he doesn't want to talk to me anymore.\n\nI was thinking of sending Eric a text tomorrow morning and ask \"Is everything okay?\"\n\nI just don't know what to do. I feel like an idiot. I feel ashamed of myself. Things are just really fucked up right now and I'm afraid of losing my friend.\n\nShould I just LEAVE him alone and not contact him for...two weeks?

I'm also a virgin.\n\nI started developing humiliation fantasies involving diapers and dresses. It got to a point where I was masturbating every single day to these diaper fantasies of being humiliated. It was bliss. It was comfort. It was an escape. I did this all through out my life and I feel like it had an impact on my growth.\n\nI tried accepting it and thinking of it as a harmless fetish and one day a woman would indulge in it. But that's just not realistic. This fetish is a big deal breaker. And it ruins my confidence. I can't be confident or happy with this fetish eating at me.\n\nIn fact, I watched so much humiliation diaper porn I don't even desire sex. Isn't that fucking sad? All I want is humiliation.\n\nA month and a half ago, I threw away all my fetish stuff. Oh yeah, one time my sister found all my diapers and brought them up in front of my parents and was freaked out and threw it away. It was pretty traumatizing. My biggest secret, and my sister found all my fetish stuff. Even a giant puffy PVC rubber diaper suit. It was the worst thing you could ever imagine.\n\nMy parents told her not to tell anyone. But Jesus, even though it was months ago, it still stings. She moved far away, and my  parents don't care....but it still hurts they know my secret. Anybody have advice on dealing with that?\n\nAnyways, I threw all my fetish stuff away. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. I also stopped masturbating, which meant no porn.\n\nThe desires were very strong, but I knew I didn't want to go back to that dark place of pain and feeling like shit.\n\nI went out with my best friend on Friday. I thought about telling him my fetishes, but he would never look at me the same way again, so I won't tell him. But I smoked weed at his house, and then went out the bar. Had a few gin and tonics and a heavy beer. I got pretty fucked up. Then went back to his house, smoked even more weed, and then went to bed in his basement.\n\nI saw this woman at the bar that I had fantasies of dominating me before. She came into my head, and all of a sudden in the dark in my best friend's basement, I masturbated furiously through my jeans and had an orgasm.\n\nIt was a horrible feeling. And at my fucking friend's house. I could never and will never tell him that. And this isn't the first time I masturbated at his house either. At his old house I masturbated to humiliation fantasies because his girlfriend was in the house and I just got turned on by the idea of being in a house with a hot woman. I never touched her or desired her before, but my fetishes take me to dark places.\n\nI then went back home and was feeling so depressed. Part of me wanted to go straight back to my fetishes. But I didn't.\n\nI was super horny and I think I had blue balls. So I did watch one last porn video of just some large girl showing her butt. I guess butts are big factors of humiliation for me or something.\n\nBut yeah, here I am again. Starting over. I just want to rewire my brain and get back to normal and desire normal sex again. I don't ever want to go back to my humiliation fetishes which only cause me pain, grief, and shame.  \n\nAnybody have advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "NoFap", "subreddit_id": "t5_2skrn", "subreddit_subscribers": 363580, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I got drunk and high and ruined my streak of a month and a half", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9mapwl/i_got_drunk_and_high_and_ruined_my_streak_of_a/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "gothboygucci", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_102yrli9", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538960895, "domain": "self.AskMen", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9mah7z/how_do_you_deal_with_past_mistakes/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9mah7z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AskMen/comments/9mah7z/how_do_you_deal_with_past_mistakes/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538960896, "score": 1, "selftext": "What if you did the worst thing you could ever imagine, how would you deal with getting through it and understanding what you did?

I've just never really been happy.\n\nI was put on various antidepressants growing up at age 14. And I've just always remained sad.\n\nI then decided I wanted to get off the medications. I was taking Duloxetine, Risperidone, and Mirtazapine. About five months ago I just stopped taking the duloxetine.\n\nOn Sept 24th, I talked to my psychiatrist and asked her to get me off this stuff. She said it was a bad idea, but lowered my Risperidone to 1MG and told me to cut my Mirtzapine in half.\n\nNow, it's only been a week, but I've been feeling extremely suicidal. Is it possible to be feeling this suicidal just from one week? I feel like I'm going insane. It's weird, but it feels like I'm high, things just feel off and things are just making me unhappy. Everything sucks and everything is miserable.\n\nI was in so much pain, that I decided to take CBD oil under my tongue. I've been doing that for almost two weeks now, and haven't really noticed anything. I also just bought a CBD vape pen yesterday and have been using that to help.\n\nI just wanted to be drug-free. But, feeling like this is just so torturous. I just really want to die. I'm unhappy all the time and life just sucks.\n\nDo I need antidepressants? Do I need antipsychotic medication? I've always had issues growing up. I've always been weird and lonely. I thought these drugs were affecting me negatively.\n\nI asked my family, and they said I was still miserable on the antidepressants. They asked me what's the difference?\n\nI thought I could get off all this medication and just use CBD, but now I'm not so sure.\n\nI thought I was doing a good thing by getting off this stuff. But now I'm not so sure.\n\nIs it possible I don't need antidepressants, but rather just risperidone or something? I mean, do I even need medication? I just feel so completely fucked up. I just want to die.\n\nMy therapist recommended zoloft. Should I just...go along with that? I mean, I can't be medicated my whole life? And if I'm taking this medication, I feel like it would just ruin my life even more and make me even more depressed.\n\nI didn't want to take Zoloft, because of how it can change your personality and make you numb. I didn't like that idea. But here I am completely depressed and suicidal, maybe I need a happy pill?\n\nI don't even know if this CBD stuff is a good idea, can't it trigger psychosis and fuck me up even more?\n\nI just don't know what to do. I don't want to take any medications, but now I think I might have to. I mean, I do have schizotypal personality disorder, so that means....what does that mean? Does that mean I am going to have to take medication? Do I need medication to not be crazy or suicidal?\n\nIs it possible to be schizotypal and not take any meds at all?\n\nI just don't want to go on. I'm in so much pain and I just want to end the pain. I'm unhappy and things just seem so dark right now.\n\nI mean, I just don't like the idea of taking a happy pill. But what if I do need it? I've been medicated since I was 14, and don't know what life is like without them. I just wanted to be med free, but I don't know if that is realistic?\n\nWhat are my options? I don't see my psychiatrist until the 28th of October. Should I just up my dose of rispeirdone, stop cutting the mirtzapine in half, and get back on Zoloft? That's like, 3 pills a day which just sounds so insane to me. I hate that. I don't want to go back to that.\n\nAm I just going to be medicated my whole life? When will this medication ever stop? Do I need risperidone every day just so I don't go crazy and kill myself?\n\nIs anyone here med free? Is it possible I can just be med free and live my life as normal people do? Do I really actually need risperidone in my life?\n\nI thought that what I'm going through is just withdrawal. And this is what people go through when they get off medication. But my god, I'm just in so much pain that I just can't stand to be alive. I don't think I can handle this. I don't even know if CBD will help.\n\nIt feels like I have a tunnel vision of depression.

Is there a way I can just use CBD like in capsules or something, sort of like a pill that is like an antidepressant I can take every morning to kick start my day and feel better?\n\nI tried a 1000MG tincture that I placed under my tongue for 90 seconds. I only did it once a day, and to be honest, I just didn't really like the effects all that much. It was weird. It felt like my body was a deep heavy numbing high that wasn't too pleasant. Did I just try something that didn't work and there are other CBD options to feel better?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CBD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zppx", "subreddit_subscribers": 45625, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is CBD good for depression?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CBD/comments/9hkhue/is_cbd_good_for_depression/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "gothboygucci", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_102yrli9", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537384131, "domain": "self.leaves", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9h81wr/do_you_feel_like_you_wasted_your_life_by_smoking/", "id": "9h81wr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/leaves/comments/9h81wr/do_you_feel_like_you_wasted_your_life_by_smoking/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1537384132, "score": 1, "selftext": "Do you ever feel like smoking has held you back in life and made you a lesser version of yourself?\n\nDo you ever wish you never started in the first place?\n\nWere those times when you were high with friends a good memory or a false memory of happiness?\n\nHas weed made your life better or worse?

I would use the excuse of being an artist and how it helps my creativity with drawing. But that is all just bull shit isn't it? Doesn't it actually make you even less creative? \n\nI grew up with a ton of issues. And pot made me not deal with these issues. I was high for like a year and was still consistently depressed. Pot was an escape from my problems. When I was high, I didn't have to face the reality that I'm a shy, quiet, nervous, loser with no friends. Pot made me more social and I had a lot of good times with friends while high.\n\nBut at what cost? Pot has caused me a ton of issues in life. I always thought it made things better, but in the end it just makes things worse. I can't believe I became a stoner. Weed sort of disgusts me now. I'm just so disgusted with how far I let it consume my life. Yet my dealer appears just fine and she says pot is for everyone and can enhance your life. Yeah, well, she doesn't have a ton of mental health issues like me. \n\nWhy is it depressed people and \"losers\" so often are the ones consuming pot? Yet there are always celebs like Joe Rogan and Seth Rogen who smoke all the time and seem perfectly happy. But I think you have to be pretty fucking stable and happy in order to indulge in pot? Because if you're depressed and smoking, it is only going to make your problems even worse. So I feel like only \"happy\" people should be the ones going for pot because it won't harm them unless they let it.\n\nI've just been going through a lot and I just think weed isn't going to help me. I feel like it's going to make my life worse because I can't be high all the time. And what happens when you're not high? I feel like I will just become even more depressed that I'm not high.\n\nFor me, it was always an escape from my harsh reality. My life is pretty fucked up and depressing, so I used weed to cope. But I don't think it's really that healthy for me to be smoking pot.  I don't even know if pot can ever be a healthy activity to indulge in. Because it just constantly fucks you up.\n\nIs it possible to have a healthy relationship with weed? My dealer actually has a kid and she smokes in secret ALL the time. She lights incense around the house and smokes in the basement. Is that sort of thing normal or is that pretty bad?

I asked my last therapist this and he said he didn't really see marijuana as a medicine, except for Cancer patients.\n\nI know that when I'm with friends smoking pot, (my friend doesn't smoke) I always have a good time. He even said that I was better socially. I'm more talkative and social and just generally happier.\n\nBut isn't that a false reality? I feel like I use marijuana to escape reality and to escape from the fact that I'm a shy, insecure, scared, lonely, depressed, anxiety-ridden introvert.\n\nThe thing is, you can't be high all the time. And I don't know if smoking every day is even that good of an idea? Can it make your life better or worse? Because if I were to smoke every day because it made me feel good, what happens when you stop? Wouldn't you become extremely depressed and feel sad that you can't smoke? So the only time you are happy is when you do smoke? So the only time you are happy is when you're not in reality?\n\nHowever, everyone says Marijuana is a medicine and can help you get better. They don't say that about alcohol, how come?\n\nI've been going through a lot. Very suicidal thoughts. Ever since I was 14, I was heavily medicated with antidepressants. I feel like I'm numb and cold and they have ruined my life. But there is hope, supposedly. When I smoked weed, I just felt immensely better.\n\nWhy is it most people agree alcohol is not a medicine but marijuana can be a medicine?\n\nMy therapist who I've been seeing since I was 15, recommended Zoloft. He was even thinking of Prozac and Xanax, but said he didn't like Xanax because it was too addicting. Something just finally clicked in my head and realized how dangerous these SSRI's were. I've never been happy in my life, so I want to make a change by instead using something like weed instead of SSRI's?\n\nI've been dealing with a lot of pain and suicidal thoughts because of these medications. I'm slowly weening myself off and my goal is to be free of these horrible benzos.\n\nI was planning on becoming a medical marijuana patient. That way I can know what I'm getting. I thought it might be helpful and might give me perspective?\n\nI think I am happier when I smoke weed. But again, that's just because I'm escaping reality by using these mind-altering drugs. But there is CBD and I was thinking of using that as well? But at the same time, I'm worried I will just become addicted to weed and just use it to cope instead of deal with my problems. But I sort of wanted to deal with my problems while also smoking weed in order to possibly feel better? I was hoping to smoke weed for a few months and then possibly just getting off the weed and then just feel better? Or am I heading down a dangerous path?\n\nIs it possible to have a healthy relationship with weed and not let it run your life? Or will it just ruin life and make things worse?

I asked one \"friend\" of mine who was a woman and she said that \"You always look nervous or anxious which makes you look like you\u2019re up to something which is where the creepy comes from.\"\n\nI also identify as \"submissive\" and watch a lot of humiliation porn that makes me feel even worse about myself. How can I be confident when I have a humiliation fetish? My therapist said that I won't be able to find a partner because of this.\n\nI've tried online dating, but nothing happens. I've been on a bunch of dates in the past. But I haven't been on a date in a very long time. On tinder I don't really get any matches, even though I swipe right on everyone.\n\nI don't think I'm ugly. I'm not overweight, actually pretty fit. My friends think I'm good looking. I have very good looking friends. And don't good looking people usually have good looking friends?\n\nI just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to be alone until my late 30s. I thought I would have had a relationship by now but that hasn't been the case. \n\n\nIs what I'm going through normal?

Am I now a different person and my brain has been damaged?\n\nI took a month break, then smoked a little bit. Then stopped for a week, and then...I bought an eighth. I made a joint, and the whole process just felt so miserable. I felt so completely stupid grinding my weed and filling up the joint and wasn't really excited or happy to be smoking. I then smoked a joint.

I feel like it's ruined a lot of things, I really don't know. I don't know if I ever want to be high again. I'm an adult and should just grow up. I feel like smoking weed is, just such a stupid thing to do to yourself. Because everything is better when you're high, but then like, you ALWAYS want to be high, speaking for myself. When I buy a sack of weed, I can't just smoke it only at night. Because I just THINK about it all fucking day and it's all I look forward to.\n\nCan weed be a healthy activity? Is it ever healthy to smoke weed?\n\nI've been having dreams of drugs. I have dreams of myself drinking lean, even though I've never done lean in my life. I have dreams of myself getting high, and it's pretty scary.\n\nI just don't know if....being high is really all that of a good thing. Because when I'm high...I just wanted to get high again and again and again, always looking for that next high. And that, just doesn't seem like a way to live life. \n\nI was buying underground street drugs. But now medical marijuana is legal in my state...should I go for it? Will it make my life better? I really don't know.\n\nAlso, something really fucking weird has been bothering me. I know I should ask my doctor, but I've been feeling this weird high sensation in my upper right chest. When I breathe in sometimes, I can feel this...high sensation. It's almost like, I'm always high or something? I don't know if that's possible. But I feel like I'm still high even though I haven't smoked in three days.\n\nI just feel so miserable. I see my therapist tomorrow, I asked him if he thought of weed as a medicine and he said not really.\n\nIs it truly better to be completely sober? Does weed ruin lives or make them better?

It's a waste of money and time, and it's not really doing anything good for me. I thought of it as medicine, but smoking a joint really isn't that medicinal.\n\nShould I smoke one last time?

I first started smoking weed around the age of 22. In the beginning I had a lot of fun. It was always a joy and music just sounded so much better. Everything was better high.\n\nI live in an illegal state, so my dealer never knows what she is giving me. So I've been smoking random batches and getting different highs.\n\nI just graduated college and now don't really have a job. In my spare time I draw and paint. In the past I used to get really drunk and that was how I was able to push through a painting. But with weed, I just felt amazing. And I don't know, can weed make you creative or is that a myth? Does weed help with painting or does it do the opposite? I like thinking it makes me a better artist, but I really don't know.\n\nI went on vacation for a month and stopped smoking weed for a solid month. During that time, I thought about weed a lot. I would think, \"Boy I could go for a joint right now\" But I sort of realized, I didn't really need it in my life?\n\nBut, doesn't weed enhance life? Does it make things more enjoyable? Why should I quit something that makes me feel good? It's like quitting drinking for good, when I don't even have an issue with alcohol. Another thing I would do is sometimes get crossfaded. I would smoke and drink and have a wonderful time. I just felt so amazing. And I just don't want to quit?\n\nAfter my vacation I found some weed that I had left over and smoked it. I didn't really feel all that high, but I was high. It was more of a body high which I don't like as much as a head high. I just felt complete dread. It didn't feel good.\n\nThe next day, I smoked the rest of what I had left. I was smoking all day trying to feel good. But the weed just made me feel pretty shitty about my whole life in general.\n\nI told myself that it was just a bad batch. Maybe it was a strain I didn't like, that's all. I just need to find the right strain that I like.\n\nI want to buy more weed. But is really that unhealthy? I don't feel like I'm hurting anyone. I like getting high and I don't see it as having a big negative impact on me.\n\nBut the brain is still growing until age 25. Am I going to damage my brain and change who I am for good?\n\nI only use weed because, it feels good. Alcohol just causes me throw up. But with weed there are no hangovers. I also started taking kratom because that made me feel good aswell. I would take kratom, weed, and coffee, and just feel complete bliss. \n\nBut jesus, that sounds really fucked up. Taking all these drugs and what not. I shouldn't be doing this. But I really don't know what to do.\n\nThere is no such thing as smoking every now and then, is there? Because weed is still in your system and stays there, right?\n\nI wish I could just vape or use edibles. But I don't have access to those, all I have is bud. And it just feels amazing, nothing else quite like it. I have no desire for cigarettes, cigars, or e-cigs. \n\nI just sort of only want to smoke at night instead of during the day like I used to. I just had so many adventures with weed and I don't want the fun to end?\n\nWhat will happen if I continue to use weed? Will it be harder to quit? Should I be a life long stoner like Tommy Chong?

But I know it just isn't really all that healthy really. I got tired of the smoke. I got tired of paranoia (I live in an illegal state). I got tired of how much money I spent on it. I was spending every single dollar I got on weed. I hated being without weed. And now I just want to be comfortable without weed.\n\nI was thinking of making the switch to kratom instead. I feel that  might actually be safer than weed. I was buying off the streets and had no idea what I was smoking. And I feel like I was hurting my brain perhaps? It's not just weed, it's a powerful drug that can affect you.\n\nI loved smoking everyday. But I think...that just isn't the way to be living, is it? Smoking everyday, sounds and feels dangerous.

Bought a pipe, bought some weed, and just started having a good time with it. I told myself I wouldn't go any bigger than a pipe, but hey I eventually bought a giant bong.\n\nGo to college...and I smoked in my dorm. The stupidest thing I have ever done in my life. My roommate was a huge stoner and also drug dealer, and we would smoke blunts just about every night. Had a few close calls. I then graduated.\n\nI have depression and anxiety. So I go to therapy and also take medicine. One pill in the morning, and two pills at night. I'm trying to get off them and I really don't think I need that shit in my life, but I can't just go cold turkey, have to slowly ween myself off. So yeah, smoking weed is probably not a good mixture with those drugs. But I'm living in the fast lane.\n\nI like to think I'm living a fun an exciting life. I just love getting stoned. Since I live in an illegal state, I have NO IDEA what I am smoking. Every batch of pot I get is always different. I love trying new experiences, and it's been fun so far I think.\n\nMy major is graphic design. The work is very hard and sometimes I just can't do it. In the beginning, I would get super drunk and make a painting. It was like, the only way I could power through and get a painting finished. But then instead of booze, I would smoke weed instead. I've created hundreds of awesome paintings thanks to weed.\n\nI got a quarter from my dealer last Thursday. I just went fucking insane and was constantly smoking. I was just trying to be so fucking lit. I just wanted to be constantly lit and hype. It felt amazing. And...I really enjoyed being this devilishly stoned. I just felt so good. \n\nI started running out of pot, so to make me remain unsober, I drank some malt liquor. I got super fucked up the past two days. I was getting high AND drunk. I felt....amazing? I mean, the alcohol kind of ruined the high, but it was fun. I had fun. I'm living a fun life?\n\nI feel like I shouldn't be doing this. I graduated with my bachelors and I'm still smoking. I thought I would outgrow this. But I just love pot so much. I want to try this strain and that strain. I want to try different edibles. I want to try different wraps. That sort of thing. I want to eventually do dabs.\n\nI wasn't really close to my room mate. But I hit him up and asked if he was still smoking. He said he was all the time. And that I should go visit him when he gets some fire weed and smoke like old times and catch up. I honestly wouldn't hang out with him if it weren't for weed.\n\nI ran out of pot today. I just have no more. I could buy more, but I sort of just want to chill for a bit? I don't know. I was lit for like five days straight. \n\nI feel guilty for getting stoned. I feel like I'm getting away with something bad.\n\nIt just feels so good. Why would I want to quit? I hear that it can damage your brain eventually. Am I hurting my brain?\n\nI've done a lot bad things with pot. I've traveled with it in my car many, many times. Went to places with it in my bag in public. Got a few close calls. I guess what's pathetic is I got SO fucking desperate for weed I decided to donate plasma. \n\nI seriously donated plasma just so I could buy drugs. I haven't told my therapist that, but I am tomorrow. Just shit like that is pretty fucked up and I haven't really dealt with understanding it.\n\nAnd it is fucking costly. I spent hundreds and hundreds of money that I don't really have.\n\nWhen I graduated, my family gave me like $300 all in total. Got it from friends and family. And I just spent it all on weed pretty much. I have plenty of clothes and books. I don't really buy anything except weed. All my money goes to weed. Every dollar, it goes to saving up for weed. I really don't have any money.\n\nMy therapist said that if I did move to a legal state, that I would become bankrupt by spending it all on weed? I find that stupid and hard to believe. But I donated plasma just so I could buy weed, so he might be right.\n\nI just don't want to quit. I can buy another bag next week. But I feel like this weed, might be hurting me in ways I don't know. Can it? I felt really happy the past two days smoking. I didn't feel suicidal at all. But now that I'm sober, those dark thoughts enter my head. I don't feel suicidal when I'm stoned. But when I'm sober, that desire sometimes pop up.\n\nDo I sound crazy?

Except during this time, he stopped smoking because he was doing gender reassignment surgery.\n\nHe got the surgery and we were hanging out here and there. We drank a lot and had a lot of fun together, but didn't really smoke together. On my 23rd birthday he took me out to a bar and got me a drink.

I wish I didn't say that stupid sentence. \n\nThen after that, he didn't really want to hang out. And then eventually I called him on the phone, and he just said that we were two completely different people. And that he didn't enjoy spending time with me as much. And that he wanted to cut off the friendship. He said that we just outgrew each other and that he just wanted to move on? He made it sound like we were dating. He was also very gay, but I don't think he was in love with me. He did try to cuddle with me one time, even though I was straight. He was being a shitty friend, but I kind of understand why he was like that. He has been through a lot.\n\nSo now it's been a year, and I have no idea what he is doing. I was sort of friends with his brother in law and we also smoked together. He was a chef and he made awesome food, so I supported his business. I'm friends with his brother in law on Facebook.\n\nI've changed a lot since then. I miss him. I just want to send one last message to him and apologize for saying that being sober sucks, because it doesn't.\n\nThing is, my friend was pretty lowkey. He didn't do social media and tried to be extremely secretive. I don't know if he even has a facebook. I tried searching for him but couldn't find anything. I thought about asking his Brother in law...but would that be weird or creepy?\n\nHe lives very close by, like five minutes from my house. Would it be wrong if I just showed up randomly?\n\nCan I ask his brother in law to send a message to him or would that be inappropriate?\n\nI just want to know how he is doing. Or should I just move on?\n\ntldr Childhood friend said he didn't want to be friends anymore, and I just want to send one last message", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "subreddit_subscribers": 1249058, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[23M] Would it be wrong to contact my old friend [23M]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8q45xt/23m_would_it_be_wrong_to_contact_my_old_friend_23m/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "gothboygucci", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1528501355, "domain": "self.OkCupid", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/8poq2w/has_okcupid_gotten_a_lot_worse/", "id": "8poq2w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 31, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/OkCupid/comments/8poq2w/has_okcupid_gotten_a_lot_worse/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1528501356, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm 23 and a few years ago, I used to get dates all the time.

I have depression and anxiety. I've been going to doctors ever since I was a kid. I take medication prescribed by my psychiatrist every morning and night. I've been seeing my therapist at least once a week and talk seriously about these issues.\n\nI finally graduated. My mom was so proud of me.\n\nI don't know what happened. I was having a really bad day. I even threw up and was feeling so sick. But once the graduation ceremony ended my family was waiting outside for me.\n\nMy mother came up to me trying to go about giving me a big hug and a kiss. I guess the kiss grossed me out or something, and so I sort of pushed her away...and I even grabbed her face I think...yeah I squeezed her face with my one hand...I was very aggressive and ugly pushing her away.\n\nAnd then we started taking pictures, and my uncle says go give your mom a hug. And I look over and to my horror she was crying.\n\nI've never felt so ashamed and horrible in my life. It's been three days since it happened, but I can't shake away these feelings of shame and guilt.\n\nMy mother was crying and said \"You don't know how hurtful you can be.\"\n\nI then apologized and then we all got together and went to a cabin. Then we went out for dinner. I then hugged and held my mother and apologized. I even sent her a text message. She said she understood my mood swings and should have known better or something. We had a good dinner, took lots of pictures smiling.\n\nEverything is back to normal.\n\nHowever, I keep feeling so horrible. I'm crying right now as I type this. I hurt my mother so much. What the fuck is wrong with me? I can't believe I hurt my mother like this. Even though I apologized and she forgave me, I can't stop feeling awful.\n\nI feel so much regret. I wish I could just go back in time and just...act like a decent human being and hug my mother back when she tried to hug me and kiss me. Why couldn't I just hug her and feel happy? I was not feeling happy, I felt very bad.\n\nI feel so ashamed. This was probably the worst day of my life. To see my mother cry at my graduation, was the worst thing I've ever experienced and I feel so guilty, ashamed, and horrible.\n\nWhy did I push her away? Why couldn't I just act normal for once? What the fuck is wrong with me? I feel so guilty for hurting my mother like that. Yeah, I apologized and she is fine now....but I keep having flashbacks of my mother weeping. It was extremely disturbing to see my mother crying at my graduation. I feel like the worst son on the planet.\n\nTo her this was a big special day. And I ruined it with my shitty behavior. I don't know why I'm such a god awful son to her. I tell her I love her. She said she understands my mood swings and thus forgives me.\n\nI made my mother cry? But I'm not in control of her emotions.

When I got to college I ended up with a roommate who was a huge stoner. Because when they asked if I was okay with smoking, I said yes because I wanted a cool room mate.\n\nEventually, we started smoking blunts and gravity bongs in our dorm. At one point we had a giant smoke session with 8 blunts going around. We never got caught. I greened out like twice with that dude. He became a huge drug dealer and was dealing a ton of weed to students from everywhere.\n\nWe did have one close call though. A police officer came to our room but since we were not there, he couldn't go in. All he found were ashes in the sink.\n\nThe halls reeked sometimes since we were smoking so much. We had a fan and a bunch of sprays. \n\nThe worst thing is when we left on winter break, my dumbass roommate left the smoke alarm covered with a hanger and a plastic bag. We almost got charged but he just said he burnt some food in the microwave.\n\nThen when I came back for the Spring semester, my roommate was gone. Said he was joining the army. I texted him but he never got back to my texts. Even told him happy 420 and never heard from him again, we are still friends on Facebook.\n\nI decided it was way too risky to be smoking in my dorm, so I stopped. I then graduated with my bachelors and I am doing very well.\n\nI also went to many of my classes high. I wrote my papers high, I studied high. And I did great, call all A's and B's.\n\nI now got a bunch of graduation money, would it be wrong if I spent some of it on weed? \n\nI just can't believe I got away with smoking in my room.

And that the brain is still developing until age 25.\n\nI asked her what age is it okay to smoke bud. And she said it wasn't a good idea at all to be smoking!\n\nI mean, pot is a huge deal. It's a drug and its impact can be dangerous. This stuff affects your brain and can permanently alter your way of thinking.\n\nI find pot to be very scary right now.  I want to quit so bad. But I love it so much. I don't want to quit. But knowing that pot could be hurting my way of thinking, is a scary feeling. How is Tommy Chong able to smoke so much and appear fine? Or is his brain fried?\n\nI just feel so conflicted and scared of pot. Living in an illegal area, I have no idea what my pot is laced with.

I was thinking of doing that or so.\n\nBut I just love bud so much, you know? I don't want to quit. I've only been smoking a year, and I feel like a different person. I feel like my thinking might have slowed down or something. I really have no idea what's going on. I just know pot is having an effect on me and I probably should quit because it's not healthy.\n\nCan pot even be a healthy thing to do?

I don't feel like driving back and forth.\n\nSo yeah, I'd rather get fucked up on my own without him. Actually, it's just because I don't FEEL like driving. I hate driving late at night.\n\nHe hits me up every freaking weekend wanting to hang out. I just him last night. And I asked \"What are you doing next weekend?\" And he says \"What next weekend? I'm thinking this weekend!\" meaning he wanted to hang...the very fucking next day.\n\nJesus. I feel like I'm being a bad friend by bailing on him. I hate lying. I don't have other friends. I don't have plans. My only plan would just be drinking alone and watching the office. That's my ideal night...but he always wants to see me...all the fucking time.

I was smoking with him all the time inside our dorm which was stupid, but never got caught. He then moved away.\n\nI live in an illegal state. My best friend's girlfriend gives me a lot of weed for cheap and always gives me extra. I could hit her up and she gets right back to me.\n\nI then stopped smoking in my dorm and focused on school. I would stay sober during the middle of the week and then go crazy and smoke all weekend.\n\nI don't have a job and I have a lot of depression and anxiety. I spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on weed with money I don't really have. I wanted weed so desperately but had no money. So I decided to start donating plasma. I seriously donated plasma just so I could smoke more weed.\n\nWith weed I feel very happy. I feel like everything is going to be okay. I would get stoned and then draw in my sketchbook for hours. So I'm creating something while stoned. It was a lot of fun.\n\nI first started drinking and smoking at age 22. I used to drink all the time and then resorted to smoking...because it's safer than alcohol, that kind of mindset.\n\nI told myself that I would just buy one more bag. And I did, and yet here I am again desiring another bag of weed. I just really like smoking.\n\nI would smoke from Thursday night all the way to Sunday night. And then Monday morning, drive an hour back to school. I even smoked a tiny bit in the morning and then waited an hour, and then drove. I just have this intense desire to smoke or feel that pleasant feeling.\n\nI think I'm an addict. I think about weed constantly. I just desire immensely to be stoned because it feels good. I feel sad when I'm sober.\n\nI wonder when this will stop. When will I grow up? When will I grow out of this phase?\n\nNOBODY is peer pressuring me to smoke. This is all on me. I want to donate plasma just one more time and then buy one more bag of weed. I want to take a tolerance break for a few months. I don't want to quit weed forever...I mean I just started smoking for once during the summer. Why would I quit now when I'm having so much fun smoking?\n\nKnowing I have weed, I feel so happy and giddy. When I don't have weed I get depressed and sometimes turn to alcohol. I've never really been sober for a while. I'm always either drinking on the weekend or smoking.\n\nI still go to school and do all my work. Never miss a class. I graduate next month.\n\nI was thinking of moving to Colorado or somewhere legal. My therapist said that if I did move to a legal place, that I would spend all my money on weed and become bankrupt. That sound extreme...but is that really possible?\n\nI feel like the solution is if I move to a legal area, then everything will be okay. \n\nBut I feel like I rely on weed too much. I feel like I desire it too much just in order to have fun. I feel like I need drugs to have a good time.\n\nWhy can't I just smoke just once a month? Every weekend I buy weed just so I can have good time. I've never been sober on the weekends.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Petioles", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vrr5", "subreddit_subscribers": 15765,

I smoke weed pretty heavily on the weekends.\n\nI saw my therapist for the first time and years and told him I was smoking. I asked him why he didn't smoke and he said \"Why alter your reality?\"\n\nHe didn't tell me to stop or anything. Just said that long time use over the years could damage my brain or change my thinking. Which kind of scares me. He used to smoked a long time ago.\n\nI just started smoking for the first time this year in the summer. Started buying bags of weed and blazing through them.\n\nI got so desperate for weed that I started to donate plasma so I could have extra cash to buy weed. So I was donating plasma and getting high.\n\nI feel like I'm never sober. Is that good or bad?\n\nThen the next day I have to drive back to school an hour. I even smoked before that hour drive. Didn't get wasted, just smoked a tiny bit to start my day.\n\nI was thinking of donating plasma this Thursday and then buying more weed.\n\nI'm not exactly healthy. Stopped exercising and plan to start again soon when it gets warmer and I could go running.\n\nIs it possible to have a healthy relationship with weed? Can I smoke and exercise and be healthy? Am I damaging my brain by smoking so much? My brain is still developing so will weed impact me negatively?\n\nI just feel so lost and afraid. I'm afraid I'm addicted to weed. But like, I still go to school and get all A's and B's in my classes. I graduate next month.\n\nI heard weed becomes a problem when it impacts your life. I don't know if it's hurting me or making things better. I just smoke and have a lot of fun. All my friends smoke. So why can't I smoke?\n\nI've been waking up early and smoking. I just can't wait to get up in the morning and smoke from my bong. Is that me being an addict?\n\nI have no one to talk about this. My next therapy appointment is the 20th, and that's a really long time to wait until I can talk again.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "leaves",
