About 2 years ago I fell head over heels \"in love\" with a girl who I had a relationship for almost 2 years. This girl was in no way/shape/or form what I imagined my ideal girl to be like. Matter of fact, we shared literally nothing in common and it was a recipe for disaster from the start. Looking back on it, she was not terribly attractive either. The breakup was extremely messy and we had some periods where we would temporarily break-up fairly often. Immediately after we broke up, she started dating a guy whom she told me \"not to worry about\" for about 5 months. After this, I became very depressed but never had thoughts of hurting myself or others. It was just total numbness to everything. I find it hard to be motivated to do anything and even playing video games isn't fun anymore without the aid of alcohol. Recently I met a girl who is both extremely beautiful (objectively, as many of my friends and family members think so), kind, caring, and believes all of the same things as me (obviously we have differences in some things we enjoy, but there are no red flags that it shouldn't work). We started talking and began dating a couple months later. When i went in for the \"first kiss\" I didn't get any sparks like I did with my last girlfriend. Matter of fact I haven't had any sparks at all in the relationship for the past 5 months. I don't find anybody else sexually attractive and my libido is almost 0 and often times I feel the same about a lamp as I do about a woman's naked body.

My previous relationship was my first long term relationship and I was completely engulfed in all of those new \"giddy\" feelings and infatuation that comes with it. About halfway through this relationship, it climaxed at a point where I ended up breaking things off with her, just to have her promise that she would change and that things would be all better. I believed her (they never got better) but literally overnight I lost all feelings towards everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. It was as if I had literally become completely emotionally numb, whereas just days before I was still bathing in the \"honeymoon\" feelings of the relationship. That relationship inevitably ended, as I could simply see no future with her and our beliefs/personalities were not compatible at all. I went into a state of depression for almost a year, but eventually came out the other side about a year and a half later.\n\nFast forward to recent times. Almost a year ago (actually celebrating 1 year on the 14th), I met a girl who was utterly amazing in every way that my ex was not. We were totally compatible in our beliefs, goals, intellect, personality, and attractiveness (I know attractiveness shouldn't matter, but it seems very balanced between us). We shared a first kiss and to my dismay, there were no sparks. I knew that regardless of not feeling sparks, I was drawn to her and we started dating. After we started dating I began to grow concerned, as i did not feel like I was in that \"honeymoon\" obsessive period that I got with my ex. I loved spending time with her and felt very very connected to her, but there was no \"spark\". I began to evaluate and scrutinize every little detail to why this was, as she is much more beautiful and sexually attractive than my previous girlfriend. We are literally compatible in every way that did not work out with my ex. It felt as if I was still single, but with a partner of whom I connected deeply (Sounds ridiculous right?) Almost as if we had already been married for years and I did not have (or desire) to see her all the time to be content though it had only been months! We talked about how we both see one another possibly getting married some day around month 6, and I did not doubt my answer though I also did not feel particularly passionate about it. After this discussion, there was no anxiety at all and matter of fact I felt MORE connected to her. \n\nNOW fast forward to today (as I write this). 2 weeks ago, we had another discussion about marriage in our future with a lot more emphasis from her to make it as soon as possible as we are both graduating and she is afraid that if we don't get engaged, we may grow apart. Immediately after this discussion, I was fine but when I woke up all Hell had broke loose inside my mind. Every day since then from waking to going to bed I constantly have the thoughts of \"do I really love her?\", \"Am I actually ready to get married?\", \"There's no one else I'd rather be with, so why does this terrify me so much? I must not actually love her.\", \"You haven't even had a honeymoon phase, something is wrong\". I've discussed the anxiety with her, but not that it is specifically around the thoughts of getting married right now. When I imagine breaking up with her, it destroys me since I walk past 1000 people per day on my college campus and none of them can compare to her, but the compulsions to break up are just so strong that it scares me. Not looking for reassurance, just someone who may have gone through the same thing or who also has these feelings of emotional numbness. \n\nPersonal background: I was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and am symptomatic of anhedonia (lack of ability to gain pleasure in things) and this feeling of emotional numbness goes for all things in my life not just her.
