Opening a conversation is also almost no problem (Im using some funny pick-up lines ironically, I usually get an positive answer) but the real problem is, i don't really know how to keep the conversation going. I understand that those girls get **a lot of** messages and they don't really want to smalltalk on those apps (like \"How are you\",\"What are you doing\" and so on) so i don't even bother doing it.  \n\n Another thing is, i tried to ask some questions like \"So, what kind of music are you listening?What kind of series are you watching\" and so on, but I guess that are boring questions and girls get those kind of questions like at least 10x per day.  \n\nAlso asking for her number after the opener never worked for me.  \n\nSo im basically clueless about the process between the opener and between asking for her number (so i can ask her out for a date later on). I don't really want to have big or deep conversation on tinder(rather starting big conversations on WhatsApp/Snapchat) but I guess i need something \"funny and interesting\" for an 20 minute conversation. So they can see im not a weirdo and at least a bit interesting.  Does anyone have some nice ideas?Or what are you \"2 go topics\" on tinder?  \n\n  \n\nAlso what are some cool first date ideas?

But i don't really wan't to get to much into the detail.\n\nSo most people recommend those things \"Go to the gym\",\"Focus on your job\" and \"Meet a lot of friends and people\".\n\n**Gym** \\- There is no gym near me, i don't really want to take public transports for an hour 4-5 times a week to the gym after work(also getting back to my apartment somehow)\n\n**Friends&amp;People** \\- Having a 9-5 job and most of my friends as well. Most people don't want to do anything after work because they're to tired.\n\n**Focus on your job** \\- Might work but im working in a office.

We tried to stay together but she did not understand that the choice was also hard for me ( i felt to young and were not ready. I made the proposal to her,it was a mistake, i know), so i had a depressive episode. She were sad, i were sad and i broke up. A week later i wanted her back and she said she is not sure if she can stay together with me. I gave her one week to decide if she want to stay together or not. A week later she told me she is still unsure (last wednesday). I told her im going to move back to my parents next Saturday(yesterday, we shared an apartment) and a day later (thursday) at the morning she told me, she really want to give the relationship a second chance. A few hours later she told me \"nvm, im still unsure move out\". So yesterday i moved out and we decided to be on a break and see if we still miss each other after a while and want the relationship back.  \n\n  \n\nA bit messy, sorry, i hope its understandable. So it was my first night at my parents and i felt horrible. I really miss her and today, in the morning i bought some roses and drove to her telling her \"I want you back, i can't think of a life without you\". She pretty much said \"okay\" but said she still want to live alone a week or two. I also told her \"If you still get the feeling it was the wrong decision, tell me and we break up again\". The thing is, right after i told her, i want her back i had this feeling \"Maybe being alone is better? Maybe it was the wrong thing to tell her, that i want her back\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR :\n\nBasically after a long back and forth, we broke up and i moved back to my parents.  \n\nWe decided to have a relationship break. \"Not being together, waiting a week and see if we want each other again\"  \n\nAfter a day i told her i want her back. She still want to live a week/2 weeks alone. I told her, if she thinks its the wrong decision she can break up again.  \n\nSo basically it went from \"Not being together - but see what happens\" to \"Being together - but see what happens\"  \n\nRight after i was unsure again if i even want the relationship again.  \n\n  \n\nI dont really know what i want, my feelings take control of me everytime. How can i decide what i want. Being seperated from her kills me. Being close to her feels wrong as well.  \n\n  \n\nSorry for my english, im really broke atm. I hope its understandable!!

At the end i told her im not ready and i wont change my mind this time. She said she still want to try to stay together. We tried it but after a week and she were mad at me because i were so cold against her. I tried to explain her, that it was not an easy decision from my side, i understand that the cancellation have hurt you the most, but it was definitely not easy for me. Cuddling,kissing and sex were super hard for me at that time, my depression kicked to hart there.  \n\n  \n\nSo, the relationship was over, the first few days were fine,i was not really sad and so on. After a week i told her, i want her back,i cant live without her. She said no, i was begging, tried to talk to her why she changed her mind so fast. She said she's not sure if she can ever forgive me and shes always thinking about how i cancelled the weeding one week before and it still hurts her.  One day she told me \"Okay, im giving you are second chance\" and 5 hours later \"Sorry, i simply can't\"\n\nWe are living in the same apartment, on that point we still shared the same bett, we started cuddeling each other,kiss each other and even had sex.She said\"we are not together anymore but since we are still living together we could at least enjoy our last time\"  \n\n6 days ago i told her, i will probably move to my parents house again (which is tomorrow) and i would give her 3 more days to rethink everything. If she tells me shes 100% sure she gives me a second chance, im down to it.  \n\n3 days later she still told me \" i believe its the best for us to breakup\",one day later (yesterday,so basically day 4) morning she told me \" i want to give you a second chance\", i told her \"tell this to me, after i come back from home\"  \n\n when i came back home i talked to her. The first thing i said \"You are still not 100% sure about all right?\", she told me \"No, i am 100% sure\", so i talked a bit with her and asking her some questions \"Are you really sure, you wont regret your decision after a day?\",\"You know, i cant help you to get through the pain, i can make small gifts,give you more attention and so on.. but i can't do it to often because else it get some kind of naturalness and you expecting them all the time\". I have told her some things that might happen \"we are could get along great\",\"we could break up in 2 months instead\" and so on.  \n\nI told her \"im down to those risks, i love you and i want you\" and she told me \"I was sure to give that relationship another chance until you made me unsure with all those questions\" and as a answer i gave her \"If you were sure, you would have been sure even after all those questions\". Was this a right answer from me? In my mind i had something like \"If someone would give me 100 cons, with love is a bad thing\" i would be still sure, that i love that person. But is this a right reflection in that situation?  \n\n   \n\nTomorrow is the day where im leaving our apartment and moving back to my parents.They told me i can come to them everytime, so even if would tell him toady \"sorry, im gonna stay together with her\" they would understand.  \n\nThe past week i woke up every morning because i actually had to throw up because im so clueless.  \n\nAlso if i imagine packing all my stuff together while she seeing that will just break my heart, it will be a mess and we both are going to cry like hell.  \n\nTomorrow when i bringing all my stuff into the car, we both will just cry the entire team. When i have her my keys of our apartment or on that moment \"her\" apartment, we are going to cry.  \n\nWe simply do not know what we want. It feelis like \"When i want the relationship and i get another chance, i feel guility and im actually unsure if the decision was right. When she wants the relationship and gives me another chance, she feels guility and is unsure if the decision was right\"  \n\n \n\nShould i talk to her one last time today and ask her whats she really want? She probably still have doubts and a lot of things are going through her head.  Should strictly move out even tho we both love each other?

Basically it's an alternative route beside going to an university. You are an employee in a company and you go to school once a week. You learning all the stuff you need for your job, in my case all things with programming and generally IT stuff. After 2.5 or 3 years you have some kind of final exam and you get an certificate for my desired job \"IT Specialist - Developer\").\n\nMy english is not perfect but readable, im planning to improve on it soon.\n\nIm also ready to learn swedish, people told me its not really hard if you speak german.\n\n* I heard a lot about the racism, some people are very racist towards foreigner. I know this question is kinda hard to answer but how do most people in sweden act towards people from germany? Normally countries hate german people or love german people, it seems like there is almost no \"middle place\".\n* I also know that sweden has a lot of refugees as well, i don't want to get political here(pro refugees,against refugees) but some swedish people i know talking bad about them. They don't like them and in germany a lot of people are against refugees as well. How are my Job chances as a immigrant? I'm not exactly a refugee but how do people act towards german immigrants? Do i even have job chances with my finished apprenticeship? And how is the job market for programmers? Are companies in lack of programmers or is the market floated with programmers?\n* How hard is it actually to get an apartment? I don't really care about the size, like an one-room apartment would be fine for the beginning but on the internet i have read about some kind of \"point system\" where people need to gain points in order to increase their chances on an apartment. Some sources on the internet even said \"You usually wait more than 10 years to get an apartment\". So is it true or just for the bigger cities?\n* What kind of cities could you recommend? Im fine with big cities or more rural areas with more nature around me. I also don't mind driving 10-15 minutes with a car to go shopping.

Basically it's an alternative route beside going to an university. You are an employee in a company and you go to school once a week. You learning all the stuff you need for your job, in my case all things with programming and generally IT stuff. After 2.5 or 3 years you have some kind of final exam and you get an certificate for my desired job \"IT Specialist - Developer\").  \n\nMy english is not perfect but readable, im planning to improve on it soon.  \n\nIm also ready to learn swedish, people told me its not really hard if you speak german.\n\n* I heard a lot about the racism, some people are very racist towards foreigner. I know this question is kinda hard to answer but how do most people in sweden act towards people from germany? Normally countries hate german people or love german people, it seems like there is almost no \"middle place\".  \n* I also know that sweden has a lot of refugees as well, i don't want to get political here(pro refugees,against refugees) but some swedish people i know talking bad about them. They don't like them and in germany a lot of people are against refugees as well. How are my Job chances as a immigrant? I'm not exactly a refugee but how do people act towards german immigrants? Do i even have job chances with my finished apprenticeship? And how is the job market for programmers? Are companies in lack of programmers or is the market floated with programmers?  \n* How hard is it actually to get an apartment? I don't really care about the size, like an one-room apartment would be fine for the beginning but on the internet i have read about some kind of \"point system\" where people need to gain points in order to increase their chances on an apartment. Some sources on the internet even said \"You usually wait more than 10 years to get an apartment\". So is it true or just for the bigger cities?  \n* What kind of cities could you recommend? Im fine with big cities or more rural areas with more nature around me. I also don't mind driving 10-15 minutes with a car to go shopping. But i don't really want to wait 10 years for an apartment.  \n* Is there any kind of help for people without apartments? Im planning to save enough money to \"survive\" 6-12 months without having a job.

We were together for almost 2 years but suddenly i got scared of your incoming wedding, so i told her im not ready. We broke up the wedding but another week later, i told her things are never going to be the same after i cancelled the wedding and broke up with her.\n\nThe first 1-2 days everything felt normal, i had no breakdowns or something like that. She started to tindering around 4 days after our breakup. 4 fucking days, after a 2 years relationship and being engaged. She writes with a lot of dudes there, she even meet them already. I also can remember that she got out of an 1 year relationship and a week later she got together with me. And please dont get mad at me for saying that. It might be a way for her to get through the breakup pain but please understand my side, that it fucking hurts.\n\nThe problem is we are still living together. If im lucky i can move out in 2 weeks but it will take most likely 1 month and 2 weeks. At least shes not inviting people to \"our/her\" apartment, shes staying away the whole night and stuff like that.\n\nShe had anger problems and yelled at me for pretty much anything but even knowing that i simply can not forget the good times with her. Basically the first 1.5 years out of the 2 years relationship were perfect, we moved a lot and changed the apartment due to troubles. We basically had nothing and managed to buy our self almost everything in our apartment (brand new kitchen, bed, new pcs pretty much everything since we both moved out from our parents). Even if we had a lot of stress we went through that together without problems. Sadly the price for that was, we basically lost our friends. We wanted to see each other nonstop and basically neglected our friends.\n\nBut even tho i just cant stop thinking about the good times. Im trying to distract myself somehow, from monday to friday im basically at work from 8am to 4.30 pm, going to gym after work and arriving at home at 6pm. At weekends im trying to get out at least on friday after work and on saturday. On sunday im usually home.\n\nI am really trying to distract myself but i get constantly breakdowns at work because i cant think of anything else. I try to persuade myself that the breakup is the right choice(which is probably true!!), i try to count bad things about our relationship but after a while i start thinking about one good memory and im getting another breakdown.\n\nAny tips on how to get past it? I know there is no real magic to get past the breakup pain but maybe something that helps me to catch myself before getting a breakdown?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : Living together with my ex girlfriend for probably another 6 weeks, she started tindering around and i get almost daily breakdowns even if im the one who broke up.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

I also asked for advice here  \n\n\n\nAt first i thought she will break up because of that, which was not the case. She had some rough days, cried alot etc. understandable reaction.  \n\nA week later she tried to act normal, tried to cuddling,kissing,sex and other \"normal relationship\" stuff. But i felt very uncomfortable. I couldnt take the initiative and do any first step. I couldnt take her into my arms,no long kisses and normal kisses felt so cold. Sex was/is an absolutly no go.  It felt a bit like im living together with my sister.  \n\nIn the past 2 weeks we had daily conversations/arguments why im so cold towards her, she could not understand why im the one who acting like he got hurt because im the one who cancelled the wedding. I shouldnt act cold and im the one who should give 200% into the relationship because im the one who ruined everything by cancelling the wedding.  \n\nWhile watching Netflix or Youtube in bed she also went mad almost everyday, she said \"Why you dont cuddle me? Do i have to tell you to cuddle me? I dont want to tell you anything you should do. Like if i tell you, i want flowers you shouldnt  instantly run into the next flowershop and buy flowers just because i said so\"  \n\n\n\nThe only thing i could answer to literally every question was \"I dont know why im acting cold. Im sorry,i dont know how to feel\" but i know, this in an answer where everyone would get mad.   \n\nSince the wedding cancellation i was way happier when she was NOT home. Distance towards her felt so good, but i dont know why. Maybe because my love was not the same anymore? Maybe because we had a lot of arguments past days/weeks and the relation between us was/is hardly stressed?  \n\n  \n\nTL;DR 1: After cancelling a weeding, i started acting cold towards my girlfriend.\n\n  \n\nYesterday we had another conversation why im acting that cold. I told her i want to break up. And now im not sure if i did the right thing. On the one hand i feel so cold towards her and on the other hand i just want to take her into my arms,give her a kiss and tell her everything is fine. I have insanely strong guilt feelings and my borderline is kicking in hard. I dont know what to feel and how to act, i just want to feel nothing at this point.  \n\nIts not to late to tell her im wrong and i want to keep trying to be together. But i dont really want to go back and forth and tell her \"i was wrong.. i want to break up/i want to stay together\" daily.   \n\nShe does not deserve that, i dont want to hurt her more than need and dont want to torture her by changing my mind to often.   \n\nSomehow i feel I destroyed her life. She moved out of her parents house to move in an apartment with me, she has almost no friends and she lost her job. Even if i somehow know its not my fault that she lost her job or no friends, i feel like she had a better life if i never came into her life. Maybe she would still have her job or more friends?  \n\nI dont know i feel like she has nothing left except me and if i leave her she has NOTHING. I want to be there for here but somehow i dont want to be there for here. I feel like absolutely shit right now.  \n\nHow can i discover my \"true\" feelings as fast as possible? How do i know if i love her or not? I cant think clearly.\n\n\n\nTL;DR2 : Broke up with my girlfriend,dont know if it was the right thing.

So last Saturday i told my girlfriend im not ready yet. She was really angry and sad, it was obvious understandable.  \nI also felt guilty but after the conversation i felt free. It was probably the hardest conversation in my life but i feel so much better right now.  \n  \nEven tho things are still difficult between us, her parents hate me and we are overthinking our relationship and thinking about a breakup everything is just better.  \n     \nSomeone said \"If you relationship cant handle a wedding postpone, your relationship wont handle a marriage\" and i think hes absolutly right. If she leaves me now, im 100% sure it was the right choice. Also someone gave me the question :   \n  \n\"If it came down to a choice between getting married and breaking up -- do you have a clear preference for one or the other?\"\n  \nAnd yes, my preference was clearly breaking up. I never thought about that way.  \n  \nI even realized our relationship has a lot of problems and im thinking of breaking up aswell. Maybe starting to focus more on myself,but i will decide that in a week or so, depends on how things will go between us from now on.  \nAlso i realized that im lacking friends and social contact. i have some friends but in the past 2 years i did nothing else than doing stuff with my girlfriend. Basically we were together 24/7 except work. I neglected my friends and yesterday i met some friends and it felt great. I honestly start doing more with my friends and trying to find new friends *SOMEHOW*  \n  \nThanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR : I was unsure about my wedding, but in the end i cancelled it and it was the hardest choice and the hardest conversation in my life.

Both times it ended like that and on the next day, my mind cant think of anything else, on how scared i am.  \nI guess the mindchange happens because i dont really want to hurt her.

A lot of people might see a big fucking warning sign \"21 and he\u2019s getting married? Don\u2019t!\" but please keep reading. Basically I really love her, we are together about 2 years now and living together for like 1.5 years. We barely have argument, we both agreed we don\u2019t want kids and so on. About a year ago I asked her, if she wants to marry me and she said yes, and in 3 weeks the day of the weeding comes. I\u2019m actually very scared and I can\u2019t find a reason, basically it\u2019s just a formal thing. I talked 2 times with her about the weeding fear, the first time I talked about my fear, she said \"You have to be sure you want that, if you are not ready, please tell me as early as possible\", I thought it was normal so I told her \"I\u2019m sure, I want the marriage\".\n\nThe second time (basically 2 days later) I randomly started to cry and I told her I don\u2019t want the marriage. She told me, looks like you\u00b4re not ready. Its fine, but I going to put off my engagement ring. It broke my heart hearing that. I tried to find the reason about my fear and the outcome was, I\u2019m just scared that I never going to have freedom again. I told her \"I\u2019m 100% sure this time. I want it, I really want the marriage\"\n\nA lot of people might think \"Yea, you going to lose your freedom, you can\u2019t have (sex-)dates anymore, meet anyone as much as you want, flirt and so on\" but that\u2019s not the freedom I\u2019m scared about. I hate dating, most of the time I basically rejected all girls from my life. I don\u2019t want one-night-stands or sex-friendships, I think sex outside a relationship or love is just disgusting (sorry for those, who have another viewpoint of it, I don\u2019t want to offend anyone) and I really hate partying. I would never ever go to a party.\n\nAnother thing I have thought about is, I never experienced to live alone in apartment. Basically I met my girlfriend when I was living with my parents, my parents started to get mad at me, when I told them I want to move in an apartment with my girlfriend and I got kicked out. So basically I went from my parents -&gt; to an apartment with my girlfriend. But on the other hand, with my parents I lived in an apartment house (is this the right word? Basically a house, where more families live in, with a lot of apartments), and the main apartment was separated from my room. The apartment was in floor 3 and my room was in the basement. So I kind of lived alone for 4-5 years. I just went into that main apartment to go to the toilet or to eat. So I roughly spent like max 1 hour in the main apartment (seeing my parents) and the rest of the day I was at school or in my room, alone. I could invite anyone I want, basically like my own apartment without a kitchen and a toilet. Also I know, if I would leave my girlfriend and search for an apartment, I would do the same as now, except cuddling and watching TV with my girlfriend at night. I would just come from work, watch streams on TWITCH.TV and waste time on twitter and Reddit etc. Basically what I\u2019m doing now, just alone. At the moment, when living with my girlfriend I can do all things people dreaming off when living alone (take a shit with open door, walk around naked, do nothing all day), I\u2019m able to do those things (even when I prefer to take a shit with a closed door haha). So I don\u2019t think the fact, I never lived in an apartment alone, is the reason why I\u2019m so scared.\n\nAnother thing is, I watch a lot of Youtuber and streamer, and they live alone and seem so happy. Basically living from YouTube (or having a part time job), eating frozen meals, junk food all day. Having fun what they doing, playing games, talking with their chat. It seems a bit like \"they made it\". Also in fact most Youtuber/streamer (at least in Germany) who are successful, are single or at least not married scares me. I kind of want to be like them. But on the other hand, I could become a youtuber/streamer. I\u2019m obviously not able to put 10 hours into that hobby every day, because I\u2019m a 9-5 worker, but I could put invest 2 hours into it. Which would be probably enough. And even - \"what if scenario\" - I would just leave my girlfriend, get my own apartment and invest all time I have left after work into that hobby. I probably would get nowhere. I would create 2-3 videos, or stream a week and would be sad that no one would watch me and just quit that. So I also don\u2019t think, that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m scared, especially because I would be able to have that hobby. My girlfriend/future wife would not stop me from that.\n\nThe only thing I can really think of, is \"what if we get divorce in a few years, for whatever reason, and I have no money to pay the divorce? I am stuck in that marriage forever? \u201cAt least in Germany divorces cost a lot of money (most of the time somewhere between 1.5k and 2k). Yea it can cost a lot more, even 10k in other countries, especially if you have a lot of valuables like a house or an expensive car. But still 2k is a lot and I don\u2019t think I will ever be able to pay that much in one. Most lawyers (divorces have a lawyer duty, so basically you can\u2019t divorce without a lawyer, and the lawyer is the most expensive thing) don\u2019t accept payment by installments, so I\u2019m forced to pay it in one. But event there I could just borrow a credit to pay the divorces. And yea, you probably shouldn\u2019t think about divorces before the wedding, but I always need a plan for failures. So that\u2019s the most points, why I think I could be scared but most of the reasons are also non existing. Are my feelings just cold feet? Logically I see no reason to be scared and even if everything fails, I could just divorce, and keep on living. Which wouldn\u2019t be nice, and which I don\u2019t want tbh, but still I wouldn\u2019t be bound to her. Because I could just borrow a credit. And even if we would cancel the marriage I would just want to live with her. Also I\u2019m suffering depression, might it be that? Basically I\u2019m doing my 9-5 job. Arriving 5.30 at home, talking a bit to my girlfriend, eat, watch something on youtube/twitch, go to bed, cuddle and watch Netflix till we fall asleep. Every single day. Maybe I\u2019m just scared my life will continue like that forever, and after the marriage I\u2019m stuck into that \"husband\" role\", like everything will change. Maybe I\u2019m scared because \"what if we divorce in 10 years? My late and mid 20\u00b4 are gone, I\u2019m old and that point and can\u2019t do crazy stuff anymore. I wasted it for a girl, who leaved me\" but as I said, even if I were single at the moment, I would not change anything, I would do the same stuff as now, just without the love-thingy until I eventually meet a new girl. Of course, marriage is a thing I have to know by myself, no one can take that decision for me. But as a stranger, what would you think about my situation? I am scared because of the marriage itself or I am just scared because of myself (basically realizing, because of that wedding, my life is just a repeating boring cycle) and it doesn\u2019t really have to do anything with the marriage. I know I should see a therapist but it\u2019s not possible in 3 weeks and I have no friends who experienced a wedding. Also if I don\u2019t really want to tell my girlfriend every 2 days I\u2019m unsure about the marriage. It\u2019s just a bs move. Sorry for the wall of text and the English grammar mistakes.

A lot of people might see an big fucking warning sign \"21 and hes getting married? Dont!\" but please keep reading.\nBasically i really love her, we are together about 2 years now and living together for like 1.5 years. We barely have argument, we both agreed we dont want kids and so on.\nAbout a year ago i asked her, if she wants to marry me and she said yes, and in 3 weeks the day of the weeding comes.\nIm actually very scared and i cant find a reason, basically its just a formal thing. I talked 2 times with her about the weeding fear, the first time i talked about my fear, she said \"You have to be sure you want that, if you are not ready, please tell me as early as possible\", i thought it was normal so i told her \"im sure, i want the marriage\".\n\nThe second time (basically 2 days later) i randomly started to cry and i told her i dont want the marriage. She told me, looks like you\u00b4re not ready. Its fine, but i gonna put off my engagement ring. It broke my heart hearing that. I tried to find the reason about my fear and the outcome was, im just scared that i never gonna have freedom again. I told her \"Im 100% sure this time. I want it, i really want the marriage\"\n\nA lot of people might think \"Yea, you gonna lose your freedom, you cant have (sex-)dates anymore, meet anyone as much as you want, flirt and so on\" but thats not the freedom im scared about. I hate dating, most of the time i basically rejected all girls from my life. I dont want one-night-stands or sex-friendships, i think sex outside a relationship or love is just disgusting ( sorry for those, who have another viewpoint of it, i dont want to offend anyone) and i really hate partying. I would never ever go to a party.\n\nAnother thing I have thought about is, i never experienced to live alone in apartment. Basically i met my girlfriend when i was living with my parents, my parents started to get mad at me, when I told them I want to move in an apartment with my girlfriend and i got kicked out.\nSo basically i went from my parents -&gt; to an apartment with my girlfriend.\n\nBut on the other hand, with my parents i lived in an apartment house(is this the right word? Basically a house, where more families live in, with a lot of apartmens), and the main apartment was seperated from my room. The apartment was in floor 3 and my room was in the basement. So i kinda lived alone for 4-5 years. I just went into that main apartment to go to the toilet or to eat. So i roughly spent like max 1 hour in the main apartment (seeing my parents) and the rest of the day i was at school or in my room, alone. I could invite anyone i want, basically like my own apartment without a kitchen and a toilet. Also i know, if i would leave my girlfriend and search for an apartment, i would do the same as now,except cuddling and watching tv with my girlfriend at night. I would just come from work, watch streams on TWITCH.TV and waste time on twitter and Reddit etc. Basically what im doing now, just alone. At the moment, when living with my girlfriend i can do all things people dreaming off when living alone (take a shit with open door, walk around naked, do nothing all day), im able to do those things (even when i prefer to take a shit with a closed door haha). So i dont think the fact, i never lived in an apartment alone, is the reason why im so scared.\n\nAnother thing is, i watch a lot of youtuber and streamer, and they live alone and seem so happy. Basically living from Youtube ( or having a part time job), eating frozen meals, junkfood all day. Having fun what they doing, playing games, talking with their chat. It seems a bit like \"they made it\". Also in fact most youtuber/streamer (at least in germany) who are successful, are single or at least not married scares me. I kinda want to be like them. But on the other hand, i could become a youtuber/streamer. Im obv not able to put 10 hours into that hobby everyday, because im a 9-5 worker, but i could put invest 2 hours into it. Which would be probably enough. And even - \"what if scenario\" - i would just leave my girlfriend, get my own apartment and invest all time i have left after work into that hobby. I probably would get nowhere. I would create 2-3 videos, or stream a week and would be sad that no one would watch me and just quit that.\nSo i also dont think, thats the reason im scared, especially because i would be able to have that hobby. My girlfriend/future wife would not stop me from that.\n\nThe only thing i can really think of, is \"what if we get divorce in a few years,for whatever reason, and i have no money to pay the divorce? I am stuck in that marriage forever?\". At least in germany divorces cost a lot of money (most of the time somewhere between 1.5k-2k). Yea it can cost a lot more, even 10k in other countries, especially if you have a lot of valuables like a house or an expensive car. But still 2k is a lot and i dont think i will ever be able to pay that much in one. Most laywers(divorces have a laywer duty, so basically you cant divorce without a laywer, and the laywer is the most expensive thing) dont accept payment by installments, so im forced to pay it in one. But event there i could just borrow a credit to pay the divorces.\nAnd yea, you probably shouldnt think about divorces before the wedding, but i always need a plan for failures.\n\nSo thats the most points, why i think i could be scared but most of the reasons are also non existing. Are my feelings just cold feet? Logically i see no reason to be scared and even if everything fails, i could just divorce, and keep on living. Which wouldnt be nice, and which i dont want tbh, but still i wouldnt be bound to her. Because i could just borrow a credit. And even if we would cancel the marriage i would just want to live with her.\nAlso im suffering depression, might it be that? Basically im doing my 9-5 job. Arriving 5.30 at home, talking a bit to my girlfriend, eat,watch something on youtube/twitch, go to bed, cuddle and watch netflix till we fall asleep. Every single day. Maybe im just scared my life will continue like that forever, and after the marriage im stuck into that \"husband\" role\", like everything will change. Maybe im scared because \"what if we divcorce in 10 years? My late and mid 20\u00b4 are gone, im old and that point and cant do crazy stuff anymore. I wasted it for a girl, who leaved me\" but as i said, even if i were single at the moment, i would not change anything, i would do the same stuff as now, just without the love-thingy until i eventually meet a new girl.\n\nOf course, marriage is a thing i have to know by myself, no one can take that decision for me. But as a stranger, what would you think about my situation? I am scared because of the marriage itself or i am just scared because of myself(basically realizing, because of that wedding, my life is just a repeating boring cycle) and it doesnt really have to do anything with the marriage. I know i should see a therapyst but its not possible in 3 weeks and i have no friends who experienced a wedding. Also if i dont really want to tell my girlfriend every 2 days im unsure about the marriage. Its just a bs move.\n\nSorry for the wall of text and the english grammar mistakes.\nThanks for everyone who went though the text.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

I learned alot by them but somehow i feel those tutorials doesnt bring me far enough to actually start my own project.  \n    \nMy biggest problem was just, he did a lot of things \"wrong\" or \"horrible\" at the beginnen of his courses to show his students in which traps they could fall for and how to fix them later. He started with almost no pattern and refactored it to an pattern just to show his students the process of it.  \nHe also did a lot of unnecessary inheritances in his Lessons(like in his Battletank course - if one is familiar with it) or at least i interpreted it like that.  \nOfc those things are actually helpful - for absolute coding beginner. But im already familar which different kind of patterns, refactoring (or writing the code as clean as possible, which is ofc not always possible but pseudocode/diagrams helping a lot)   \n    \nAnd i said - after watching 3 courses of him - i dont feel like i complety understand the engine. Im a bit more familar with the engine yes, but i want to learn more.   \nI have a lot of programming knowledge already, mostly in C# and Java but my C++ knowledge increased by a lot in the last few weeks.   \nBasically i want to learn more about the engine specific features, i want to learn how to set up an third person character with my own meshes, animate them etc etc. Build my own Player Controller, which is not unnecessary complicated. Also maybe even some basic lightning, mapping/material things,performance tips etc.  \n  \nAs i said im mostly interested in C++ but i have no problems with blueprints. Im interested when you should use BP or when is C++ recommended. For example Ben Tristem did his input via blueprint and called a method in C++ (e.g Mapping x to \"fire\" -&gt; on Blueprint \"if fire\" -&gt; call c++ method\") while i see other people doing the complet input in c++.   \n  \nMost UE Tutorials (and i belive even the official ones) are mostly ONLY BP and thats something i dont want. I have also checked some links in the Tutorials section, but im interested in a few more, maybe from people who were in a similar situation like me.  \n  \nGreetings!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "unrealengine", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x11n", "subreddit_subscribers": 37890, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Best learning sources for ue4 (mostly c++)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/9aaacu/best_learning_sources_for_ue4_mostly_c/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Kageyashax", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1534743107, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/98qyas/life_is_meaningless/", "id": "98qyas", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/98qyas/life_is_meaningless/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1534743108, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 379591, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Life is meaningless", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/98qyas/life_is_meaningless/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Kageyashax", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1534441771, "domain": "self.PS4", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/97uhm5/ps4_doesnt_read_disc_anymore/", "id": "97uhm5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/PS4/comments/97uhm5/ps4_doesnt_read_disc_anymore/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1534441772, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, \nmy PS4 won't read my disc's anymore.  \nAfter I insert a disc the ps4 ( prob the disc drive) starts making a clicky sound (like it trying to read the disc) and after a while it says \"can't read the disc\". \n \nIt started 3 weeks ago and normally I could just tap on the ps4 (where the disc drive is located) and the ps4 was able to read the disc, at least while I'm tapping on the ps4.

What I actually really like you can play the first game of kingdom hearts and be like \"yea, I know everything about the game\" but then a prequel came out and you be like \"uf, I was so naive, I did not know anything about it\" and you mind were blowing because that prequel changed everything you knew about the first game (for those who played Kingdom Hearts you should know what I'm meaning?). \n \n- active community (e.g subreddit, speed runs etc) \n \n-another big plus is if the game has a bigger series and the series isn't finished yet.\n \nWhat I don't like : pure medieval settings (like Witcher 3 or skyrim), games that are 100% anime looking like tales of. \n \nAs I said those are just preferences and idc about the genre, I'm open to literally every genre it should just fulfill one point.

So my goal is to \"heal\" my releationship,get it like it was a few month ago, before it is late.We living together.  \n  \nAbout me : Im a very negative person,got borderline and depression. Actually a very boring person. Thats probably a reason why thinsg turned like that. Im working 8 hours a day and after that i usually just want to lay in bed and want to watch something with her. Im open to do some things outside (or w/e) but i have no idea what. I dont even care if i have fun,i just want her to have fun, but im so clueless.  \n  \nThe thing is, i feel like she is to bored of me. She doesnt enjoy the time together anymore. Recently she lost her job and she needs something to do. I understand that,she also looking for a new job and while im working she playing a mmorpg called \"fiesta\". I know that she was very addicted in the past,im not happy about that she started to play that game again but whatever(ive also told her that). But recently she started to play to much. Basically all she does is playing. For example we used to eat breakfast together, but since a few days she eats her breakfast alone while playing that game. We used to go together to bed and watching something before we sleep(netflix,youtube,tv etc) but lately she stays up very long just to bed and i have to go alone to bed. Yea she basically playing all day. It would be fine if she at least spend some time with me,or stop playing when im coming home(since she has like the entire morning/noon to play) but she doesnt care. If im trying to talk about that topic she just says \"If you do not entertain me,im gonna entertain myself somehow else\", like i know im a boring person and i want to change that but is it really my job to entertain her? Shouldnt she do something aswell? And if she really want to spend time with me,shouldnt she do some suggests aswell? I feel like that sentence was just an shitty excuse.  \n  \nAlso she rarely takes initiative(like kissing me,doing the first step before sex like even saying that she want sex right now) but this problem started even before she started playing that game. And if i want to talk about that, like asking her if she could kiss me at least sometimes from her side shes just saying \"If you want a kiss, just kiss me or ask me\" same for sex. Ive also tried to tell her that i want her to do the first step at least sometimes,that she should show me some love. But shes always answering \" i dont know if you want that at this time. If you dont ask, i feel like you\u00b4re happy that i dont annoy you\" but im pretty sure she knows, that i love small things like that,shes just using that as an excuse. Anyway if she says that the disscusion is over most of the time since i dont know what to answer to that except \"You dont annoy me,i love that\" and nothing change after that.  \n  \nI thought that she doesnt love me anymore,ive asked her couple of times and told her she can tell me the truth. She doesnt have to be scared or something but she always saying that she still loves me and she cant think of a life without me.  \nSomehow im trusting her, that she still loves me but on the other hand i feel so unwanted(escp physical).  \n  \nSorry for my bad english, english is not my native language.

I tried something like this :  \n  \nif(Clipboard.ContainsText()){\n//true,clipboard has a string,number w/e in it\n}else{\n//false, clipboard is not a text\n}  \n  \nThe thing is, Clipboard.ContainsText is always returning false.If i have something like this \"Hello, my name is Kage!\" in my clipboard and im trying one of these :  \nConsole.WriteLine(Clipboard.ContainsText(TextDataFormat.Html));  \nConsole.WriteLine(Clipboard.ContainsText(TextDataFormat.Text));  \nConsole.WriteLine(Clipboard.ContainsText(TextDataFormat.Rtf));  \nConsole.WriteLine(Clipboard.ContainsText(TextDataFormat.UnicodeText));  \nConsole.WriteLine(Clipboard.ContainsText());  \nEverything is false, but why?
