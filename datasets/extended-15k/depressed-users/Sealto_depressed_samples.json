was:\n\n\n-emotional selfregulation\n\n-restlesness(mind and body)\n\n-selfmotivation/procastination \n\nEmotional selfregulation improved alot right at the beginning.\nrestlessness of the mind improved alot in the beginning and even more with a higher dosage.\n\nBut then there was self motivation and procastination...and i felt like not rly much had changed.\n\nSo i thought about that and realised that i still wake up and sit in front of my PC watching youtube or playing games all day.\nBut there was one change i noticed that maked me curious.\n\nBefore meds if i decided at 10am to clean the dishes, it took me to at least 22pm or until the next day to actually do it.\n\nBut now with meds if i decide to wash the dishes i get up RIGHT AWAY and do it, or maybe with a small delay from 10 - 30 minutes.\n\nThats an tremendous improvement to 12 to 24 hours before!\n\nSo i ask my self, why i am still so freking unproduktiv?!?!\nOkay i have a pretty severe depression and this take part in that for sure.\n\nAnd then i realised, that its all about habits. \nIt was my habit to do nothing productive for almost 3 years now.\nBefore meds i tried alot of times to structure my life with, alarms, written routins and so on. But i couldnt stick to them no matter what...\n\nSo i thought okay, now while you medicated try to change these habits and try again. \nI wrote a daily plan, set up alot of alarms for different task, try to keep me busy and reward myself at the end of the task with a little gaming time or a youtube video to watch.\n\nAny you know what? \nWorks like a charm =)\n\nI get up, eat breakfast and take my meds and chill for about 30 - 45 mins.\nAnd then i can start without any Problem. \nI clean my room and me daily, wash my clothes, eat regulary, do sport every 2 days, work on my way back into a job, started a charity job for the kindergarten of my son and so on.\n\nFinaly i can stick to all the things i learnd in cbt!\nAnd yes finaly my depression gets better bit by bit!

the following english text will hurt your eyes, i am sorry i try my best.\n\nHey, \ni dont know what i hope to get from that rant, but i think i need a place to write it down somehow.\n\n\nWhere to start...?\nI am a 33 year old male, that is diagnosed with depression an anxiety disorder and emotional unstable symptoms for 2 1/2 Years now.\n\nSince then and little bit beforehand my live is nothing less then a living hell.\n\n\nI a had a 6 week hospital visit in the beginning and since after that im going to therapies every 2 weeks, and yeah talking to someone helps for the moment but positive long term effects are still missing.\n\nAnd is so fucking frustrating, because in my head i know what to do, i learned many skills, i know i should do things, i should go do fitness, meditate and so on and i know this things would help me to get better...but i can not motivate me to do those things even when i know it would help me.\n\nThe best i can get is a 2-3 day motivation spike and then just stop doing the good things. \nBAM getting even more frustrated as before....\n\n\nMy kind of depression is sadly not the emotionless dull feeling of senselessness, i am so full of sadness, regret, self-hate and it overwhelmed me on a daily basis.\n\nI semi tried to kill my self many times in this timespan, but (luckily) the last resistance of the will to live in the brain is hard to overcome in the final moment.\n\n\n\nI have absolute zero self-esteem and i try to get it by helping other people...im a rly helpful and a total honest guy but my need to help other people to feel good about my self drives me into one destructive relationship after another.\n\n\nI'm total attracted to women with mental disorders like Borderline, bad life states and a loose moral. \nWomen i can help...because when i help you, you are thankful and wont leave me....and the only thing is i destructed my self with the relationships and throw me deeper into the dark hole of Depression.\nI by my self am hyper sensitive, have a high moral standard and an extreme distinct sense of justice. \nThis collides with the destructive lying and cheating women i pick. \n\nAnd i know i do this to my self in full awareness of it, but i cant stop doing it.\nFor sure i took my part to failing this relationships, my RSD is wrecking me hard, i hardly can distinct between the real intent of someone actions or sayings and the shit my mind is making up.\n\n\nWitch results in an extreme fear of being left, left alone, jealousy and anger explosions.\nI do not physical harm anybody, i never did but oh boy, if i think someone is hurting me..... my kindness gone, my extreme empathy...gone.\n\nI'm good in seeing Peoples worst wounds, failures and so on and in this Moments, i use this information to grow to a cold blooded emotional Murder. \n\nI become the extreme opposite from whom i normally are. I hate this...i hate me....\n\n\nThis rush of anger stays for a day or 2.....and then i am so sorry....so regretful...\nThe anger goes, the wound stays...yeah my reaction is total wrong but i get hurt...and it hurts so hard...and it stays..and stays...for months and months. \n\n\nI cant distinct my emotions from my thoughts.\nThere is absolute no room between these two.\nI mostly live in my head, my emotions often are results of my thoughts of things, happened, could have happened, will maybe happen or not and so on. \n\nI catastrophizing everything in my head and these thought transform instantly into emotions.\nAnd still i am aware of the fact that i feel this deep sadness because of made up thoughts. \nI know all this logically, but i cant for fuck sake use that information to change anything. \nIt frustrates me only more to know it, but cannot do it.\n\n\nSo know comes the ADD part. \n\nI got ask many times by people if i had ADHD, my Psychiatrist ask me if i am always so restless. \nI said yeah i am and no i dont have ADD.\n\n\nFor me ADD was not being able to sit still and not be able to concentrate. \nThis didn't matched me i thought....but holy cow was i wrong and i learned now that there is much more to ADD as i thought to that time.\nAfter i got asked the 7 time or so, i started to research ADD...and i matched almost every symptom.\n\n- \tI thought i am super good in concentrating, if i rly want to do \n        something i can concentrate easily, but the things i cant \n        concentrate on...i just dont do these things. \n\tThat is why i never saw that problem.\n\n-\tI feeling restless all the time, my thoughts are racing, \n        collapsing all the time 3..4..5.thoughts and more all at the \n        same time.\n\n-\tI am bored all the time, my life is boring, everything is \n        boring...\n\n-\tI am so impatient, i hate waiting....so much! And for me life \n        is a cycle of waiting. You wait for something to do or to \n        happen only to wait for the next thing afterwards....you wait \n        forever.\n\n-\tI get excited over things easily. New film?Game?Hobbies? \n       Count me in! Then i will relentlessly do nothing else than that \n       for 3 days - 2 weeks just to stop.(This was before the \n       depression)\n       As an example, i paint warhammer figures. 2 - 3 times a year \n       it get to me and i start painting for a week or 2, thinking on \n       nothing other then painting these figures. And just before i \n       finish one, i stop...put them back on the shelf and puff gone.\n\n-\tI am highly risked to get addicted. I am strongly addicted to \n        cigarettes(40 a day), i had a phase of 3 Month non stop \n        drinking. \n\tI am for sure addicted to Internet Porn... Smoking Weed \n        from time to time, tried LSD to cure my depression(didn't \n        happen, but helped me allot with my anxiety)\n\tThe only good thing is that i can handle that, as soon i figure \n        out a substance use gets out of control i stop using it.\n\n-\tI cant motivate me to do simple task like taking a shower, \n        brushing my teeth and so on. I procrastinate everything. \n\n-\tAs an 8 year old i was in therapies for my lack of impulse \n        control and anger problems for 1 1/2 years.\n\tI ask my mother if ADD was ever a thing and she sad no. \n        Yeah you couldn't concentrate, cant sit still, the anger issues \n        and all that but my mother never saw that as a Problem. My \n        little brother has add diagnosed as a child.\n\n-\tI stopped working as soon the depression started, but \n        beforehand i was lucky to work in a job i rly liked, and hardly  \n        ever my work got controlled. \n\tI could do what ever i want...so i did nothing until a Project \n        arrives that get me hooked.\n\tNow 2 years without a job, everything broke apart....i am in \n        an debt crisis...and i could solve the crisis...but i cant get up \n        and do it...i know what to do...and i do it sometimes....in the \n        last possible moment.\n\n\nSo now i was 100% sure i have ADD. And it was a little little glimpse of hope in all that darkness, a kind of relief to have a name for it.\nI spoke with my therapist and told her what i discovered and think. She agreed with me and together we called the \"Uni clinic Bremen\". \n\nThey offer a ADD diagnostic and i got an appointment 1 1/2 Month later.\nAnd i have to say, i never was so near suicide as in this time frame. \nBut the appointment kept me here....i throwed everything of hope i got left to this date.\n\n\nMy therapist then prescribed me Bupropion. \nI needed a new antidepressant anyway, and Bupropion is known to help with ADD symptoms. I live in Germany so that's was my only Option for meds without a proper diagnose.\n\nI started at 150mg and it changed little to nothing. After 3 weeks upped the dose to 300mg....oh boy...first day i took the dose my mind suddenly becomes sorted, 1 thought after another. There was suddenly a little room between my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI was more motivated but i felt also a little bit shaky and weird.\n\n\nThe positive effects stayed with me for 3 days, and since then they are gone....never came back, it is a little tiny bit more easy for me to get up and do things that's all. \n\nAnd the anti depression effects are not there ether...\n\n\nToday, the appointment was 2 days ago. \nI had an 1 hour talk with psychiatrist and then i clicked through 150 questions on the Computer. \n\nThey now evaluate all this and next week Friday i go back to them and they give me a diagnose and the possible treatment ideas.\nThe psychiatrist wouldn't give me a diagnose before the evaluation but she said its pretty clear an ADD.\n\n\nI know an diagnose wont magicly change everything, but i hope that with ADD meds i can finally take my logic and knowledge and DO SOMETHING WITH IT! \n\nAlso i rly need a emotional puffer between my thoughts and my feelings.\n\n\nI am pretty good in reflecting my self and i fight for a long time now and i know i cant fight much longer. \n\nI am fading....\n\n\nI will keep on going for a couple of month for sure, but i know for sure i wont get through that another year.\n\n\n\noh gosh that's not even half of my story but enough for now. \n\n\nI am thankful for every good advice and will follow it for 2 days before stopping it =D\n\n\nAgain im sorry for my bad English skills.\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Vent/Rant ADHD + Depression", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/82xcj6/ventrant_adhd_depression/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Sealto", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520423978, "domain": "self.ADHD", "edited": 1520424293, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/82nqji/adhd_depression_my_story/", "id": "82nqji", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/82nqji/adhd_depression_my_story/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520469574, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "ADHD + Depression, my story...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/82nqji/adhd_depression_my_story/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Sealto", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1518540488, "domain": "self.slaythespire", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7xapk9/bugs_beta_patch_1302_strengh_scaling_bottled_flame/", "id": "7xapk9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/slaythespire/comments/7xapk9/bugs_beta_patch_1302_strengh_scaling_bottled_flame/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1518591668, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I encountert 2 Bugs today in my runs, maybe 1 is intentional dunno.\n\nI was not able to remove a card from my deck with various card removel options that i had previous choosen with the [[bottled flame]]\n\nSecond i had a strange strengh scaling bug.\n\nI had 16 Strengh and 6 Armor and [[pen nib]] active.\nResult was 66 Damage trough a bodyslam.\n\nSomeone encountert the same issus.\nI couldnt recreate it, because i had no other run with pen nib or bottled Flame.\n\nGreetings", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "slaythespire", "subreddit_id": "t5_3hbbd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[BUGS] Beta Patch 13.02 Strengh scaling, bottled flame", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7xapk9/bugs_beta_patch_1302_strengh_scaling_bottled_flame/"}, {"author": "Sealto", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1518089556, "domain": "self.slaythespire", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7w46hj/beta_branch_the_collector_diffilculty/", "id": "7w46hj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/slaythespire/comments/7w46hj/beta_branch_the_collector_diffilculty/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1518137819, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 22, "selftext": "Is it just me or did they buff the collector way too hard?\nOkay, I'm playing on acsension 13 atm but....
