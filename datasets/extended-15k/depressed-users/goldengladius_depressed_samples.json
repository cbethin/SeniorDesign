I don't know how to describe it other than it felt like absolute pain, and like happiness stopped existing. After I started started having rogue thoughts of self harm I went back on the pills, but never told anyone about my thoughts. I've also been going to a therapist who has said, \"you have depression\" but never formally diagnosed me. I don't know if I'm qualified to post here, and if I'm not I apologize.\n\nLess than an hour ago I had an impromptu conversation with my grandpa. I've lived with my grandparents since around the same time I started taking depression meds. The conversation started with me venting my frustration with college and a paper I just realized was due in two days alongside a test in the same class on the second day. Eventually it evolved into him giving me some advice for life, and we had a conversation about my future, how to prepare for it etc, and I expressed some of my fears. I told him that I'm worried that I'll end up staying at home with them for years after college due to the economy, but really I was worried about them hating me if that happened, which I didn't say. He told me that that only happens to people without a plan, and that in America you can always be successful if you're determined and a hard worker.\n\nI don't believe this. This is something that I think is fundamentally untrue in modern society, and I tried to convince him. I told him my opinion, that determination and hard work are necessary, but that it's not everything, but he disagreed. I have him statistics, studies and facts but he threw them out the window and kept reiterating. He told me to be careful not to use my expression as an excuse.\n\nThat's when it hit me. He's so different, over 50 years older, raised differently, that we're incompatible. I realized he probably doesn't even really understand depression, and probably can't. Now I realize that I can't go to my family for help anymore, after I learned years ago that my grandma has the same beliefs that he does. At first I thought it was just political, but then I realized our differences. We don't have any hobbies in common, don't really like the same books/movies/shows, and have completely different outlooks on life, happiness and how to obtain it.\n\nWhat now? I need to figure myself out. I'm stuck between teenager and adult and I've gotta figure out how to find my own happiness before I get out of college. I'm terrified of having to stay with my grandparents after college, I feel like they'll be mad at me for not trying hard enough. And I'm pissed that he told me not to use my depression as an excuse. There have been days when I thought that I'd never amount to anything, that I should give up before it's too late, and every action I take towards improving myself, towards doing well in college, there's this voice that tells me to stop. It says that I'm not a productive person, that I'm a procrastinator, that I'm a failure, and that I shouldn't even try to be anything else. But I guess that's just an excuse.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 404820, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think my family and I are fundamentally different.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9wc0g0/i_think_my_family_and_i_are_fundamentally/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "goldengladius", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_168tjr", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538604484, "domain": "self.AskReddit", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9l5vt3/redditors_who_married_their_best_friends_whats/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9l5vt3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9l5vt3/redditors_who_married_their_best_friends_whats/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538604485, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "subreddit_subscribers": 20263129, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Redditors who married their best friends, what's your story?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9l5vt3/redditors_who_married_their_best_friends_whats/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "goldengladius", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_168tjr", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538595068, "domain": "self.AskHistorians", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9l4hhn/what_were_late_romans_views_on_pontius_pilate_the/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9l4hhn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AskHistorians/comments/9l4hhn/what_were_late_romans_views_on_pontius_pilate_the/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538595069, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "subreddit_subscribers": 814887, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What were late Roman's views on Pontius Pilate, the executor of Jesus of Nazareth?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9l4hhn/what_were_late_romans_views_on_pontius_pilate_the/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "goldengladius", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_168tjr", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535839668, "domain": "self.WritingPrompts", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9c71lu/wp_after_you_won_a_drinking_contest_with_god_he/", "id": "9c71lu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "flairwp", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Writing Prompt"}], "link_flair_text": "Writing Prompt", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9c71lu/wp_after_you_won_a_drinking_contest_with_god_he/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1535839669, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "subreddit_subscribers": 12627667, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[WP] after you won a drinking contest with God, he gave you the power to grant people knowledge.
