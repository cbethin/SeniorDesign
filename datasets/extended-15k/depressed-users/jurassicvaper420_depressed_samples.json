English is not my first language, so sorry if i type in a funny way, oh well. Decided it was worth something posting this online, i was lurking for some time and yeah, here it goes (It\u2019ll be a long one)\n\nI have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety since i was 15, i had a breakup where i witnessed my first girlfriend having sex with a friend of her. Well, let\u2019s just say those weren\u2019t my best days. Took tons of meds and life goes on, and eventually i found the strenght to fight it with a lot of friend support and theraphy, and got better to the point i was finally... comfortable with existence i guess?\n\nI always had trust issues since ever, and being cheated didn\u2019t exactly help it. My parents are divorced and they were always manipulative regarding me; I was bullied a lot for being asian here in Brazil, and always thought i looked like shit, because well beauty patterns and stuff. I think you guys get the picture.\nWell, and then everything changed when i was 19 and my cousin and best friend died on a bus accident. There i knew what pain really meant. It devoured some part of me and never gave it back. Ever. Sometimes i try to comfort myself trying to believe in things i really don\u2019t, but that\u2019s just me trying to create possiblities to accept death. But life goes on.\n\nThere was a time where i was just so tired of feelig miserable and being comfortable with it that i stopped pitying myself, and just started making my way out of that hole, with little steps. Went for jogs, then working out, talking to strangers on elevators, until i became functional. Started studying to get an engineering degree, made a lot of friends, went to a lot of parties and started living life; got my first job, car and yadda yadda\n\nBut something was bugging me for a while, and now i just realized i never trusted anybody in my life, nor i ever felt attracted to someone to the point of developing emotions or attachment; and i just feel empty. I care about friends, my cat, i love my family and everything i\u2019ve built until now but still i feel empty. Because i don\u2019t trust anyone. My mind always thinks of possibilities of someone betraying me in the most diverse possible ways and literally tortures me until i don\u2019t care anymore and eventually lose interest. It is horrible and is destroying everything again. I feel like i\u2019m slipping back and as if i \u201cunlearned\u201d everything until this point on what being healthy is, and forgot what not thinking like this feels like.\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 405824, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How am i supposed to trust people?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9x65hh/how_am_i_supposed_to_trust_people/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "jurassicvaper420", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_id": "t2_1gaoybs1", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1531402772, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/8y9uny/she_purrs_every_morning_and_sleeps_while_i_caress/", "id": "8y9uny", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/aww/comments/8y9uny/she_purrs_every_morning_and_sleeps_while_i_caress/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1531402773, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aww", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o", "subreddit_subscribers": 17505243, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "She purrs every morning and sleeps while i caress her", "url": "https://i.redd.it/sojvyhk5ti911.jpg", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "jurassicvaper420", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1527393883, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Rateme/comments/8mfgxa/21m_throwaway_account_just_be_honest_yo/", "id": "8mfgxa", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/Rateme/comments/8mfgxa/21m_throwaway_account_just_be_honest_yo/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1527393884, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Rateme", "subreddit_id": "t5_2re84", "subreddit_subscribers": 92054, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "[21M] throwaway account, just be honest yo", "url": "https://i.redd.it/718b8tmoob011.jpg", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}]}
