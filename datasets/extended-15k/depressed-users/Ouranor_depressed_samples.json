It\u2018s been really fun and fulfilling so far, but is also now, after our vacation days, starting to become more challenging.\n\nAnyhoo, I have this classmate (male, late thirties) who fell quite ill, was hospitalized and then fell into a deep depression. According to him, he gets these deep depression every couple of years and knows how to deal with them. It\u2018s been up to me to gather homework and keep track of what we\u2018ve learned at school to facilitate an easier return for him. I\u2019m glad to help however I can and see it as an opportunity to get better organized :). Btw, our school and teachers deserve a huge shoutout here, they\u2018ve been amazingly supportive!\n\nAnyway, I\u2018ve been quite hands-off with him, simply asking him what he needs and how I can be supportive. He told me that he needs more rest and that he\u2018ll call me next week. I of course respect his wishes, but here\u2018s the thing: he\u2018s been saying that for the last two weeks. \n\nNow, he\u2018s been missing school for several weeks, and might miss the next couple of weeks as well (let\u2018s hope not). I wasn\u2019t kidding when I say that this school is getting tougher, even with us (classmates and teachers) doing our best to \u201ecompress\u201c all of the new material down to its bare minimum.\n\nI\u2018m reaching a point where I might need to insist to have a more \u201eserious\u201c talk with him, to let him know that the load isn\u2018t getting any smaller, aka that we need to actually sit down and organize soon-ish, but that I and everyone else (we\u2018re a very small class and are close) are also there to support him every step of the way. I do NOT want to put on any pressure, but I also want to be real with him. I have diagnosed depression myself, but it\u2018s mild and I know how to cope when it hits. I have NO CLUE how to deal with someone who completely isolates himself.\n\nALSO: I know that his mental health and career are not my responsibility. But I do want to do more than just throw the pile of work at him (if he lets me, I won\u2018t push if he doesn\u2018t).\n\nIn short: I really care for him and don\u2018t want to make his depression worse, but I DO need to talk to him about work soon. Nobody in the school wants him to quit because he is an awesome guy and would be missed if he left. He also keeps insisting that he misses us and wants to come back. Do you guys have any advice on how to approach this the right way? Is there anything specific that you guys would appreciate to hear if you were suffering and can\u2019t get out of bed? As far as I\u2018m concerned, an honest inquiry from the heart never hurt anyone, but I don\u2018t have the experience to be sure. It also hasn\u2018t done much so far...\n\nThank you guys SO much for your time. Apologies again if this doesn\u2018t belong here.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 399594, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Helping a friend in need", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9rxnt3/helping_a_friend_in_need/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "Ouranor", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "-020lbs", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "27/F/5'7.5\" | SW: 282 | CW: 258 | GW: 176"}], "author_flair_text": "27/F/5'7.5\" | SW: 282 | CW: 258 | GW: 176", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1522958773, "domain": "self.loseit", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/8a318k/why_cant_i_freaking_stick_to_it/", "id": "8a318k", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/loseit/comments/8a318k/why_cant_i_freaking_stick_to_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1522960942, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "subreddit_subscribers": 788629, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why can\u2019t I freaking stick to it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/8a318k/why_cant_i_freaking_stick_to_it/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Ouranor", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1521126380, "domain": "self.offmychest", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/84n55c/naw_my_father_and_his_sister_have_fucked_up_one/", "id": "84n55c", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/offmychest/comments/84n55c/naw_my_father_and_his_sister_have_fucked_up_one/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1521175180, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Obviously, I am far from the only one to have an issue with my father and his behaviour.

I am absolutely, 100% torn at all times about sentiments like these, because I am fully aware of how hypocritical and awful they are. But I really want to put them out there, in the hopes of lessening my own burden, maybe.\n\nLet me try to explain as badly as I can:\nThe issue is that I have had depression since I was a child (among other things), but I can still function as a sibling, offspring, friend and employee. The guilt and sense of duty I feel towards any work (that I don't give a damn about) makes me get out of bed. So when I see all the depressed people that are literally unable to leave their homes, live on benefits and are objectively worse off than I am, I STILL deeply resent them for getting what I myself \"hope\" for. You know, being left alone all day, not really taking responsibility for my life, wasting away in peace etc... I OBVIOUSLY know that I should consider myself lucky to NOT have this bad of a depression (I have diagnosed moderate depression with bouts of heavy episodes). But I am jealous, resentful, bitter and only stop myself from actively saying these things because I like to think that I have SOME shreds of compassion and decency left. And I realize how wrong I am about this, but the thoughts just keep coming back.\n\nOn good days, I feel nothing but empathy towards the people that are suffering and count my blessings. But on bad days, like today, my mind goes incredibly dark. My first reaction to most people talking about their struggles is something along the lines of \"Yeah, go ahead. Please DO stop bitching and DO kill yourself, you're literally a failed and broken piece of human engineering that should be prevented from ever reproducing or wasting our limited resources.\", among other things. I used to be horrified and shocked at the dark and violent thoughts (a hankering for Eugenics, how freaking charming indeed) towards the mentally ill and the handicapped, but now I've grown almost used to them. I realize that this is worrying, even if it IS only inside my own head for now. Maybe an interesting note: I have an uncle that has been severly handicapped his entire life (unable to walk, speak, eat, live on his own. He's a gross baby in an 50-year old body) and has been nothing but a huge burden to the entire family. He is loved, but let's be real. If they could choose again, my grandmother and her other children would do some serious thinking.\n\nStill, I rightfully feel like a piece of shit, and all these dark thoughts obviously apply to me as well. But I do not hate myself. I just accepted that I am resentful and bitter and terrible, and that there are numerous reasons why I will not find happiness with other people in this life unless I manage to curb my awful, mean-spirited streak.\n\nI guess what I want to know is if anybody can relate, or if I'm really alone in my awfulness. I also tried googling if maybe this \"penchant\" for viciousness aside from depression has a name/diagnosis, but I couldn't really find anything. Though you might not believe it, I have a huge capacity for love. I love whole-heartedly, but I lack in the empathy and patience department I guess. I always wanted to be kind, but I get the feeling that I simply don't have it in me. At least not in this life.\n\nAnyway, I do feel a bit better now already.

Honourable mentions go to: Calamity, Lord Jabu-Jabu, Valoo, Great Fairy (BotW, because dang) and Ilia!\n\nWhy did I post this? Because I hope it gives some of you guys a laugh too, and maybe there's even some Zelda fans here that could give me some suggestions what the different levels could be, because none of this is actually based on research/lore, just what I remembered off the top of my head :D! Maybe someone will make a guy version for themselves, too?\n\nAnyway, I hope you all achieve your goals and have a fabulous day!

First time poster here after having lurked in the shadows for about two weeks, how are you all?\n\nI just wanted to shout into the void real quick... I've been having such a great, healthy run (cooking, eating well, intermittent fasting, depression managed, all good!) for almost two months, but today's been my third day of binging in the evening.\n\nStress from work hit me really hard these past few days and it's really frightening how little it takes for me to fall back into old patterns. I lost 12kg from January to mid-Mai (I was in a clinic to treat my depression and eating disorder and to get a grip on life), but my return to work didn't go well at all (closest co-worker guilt-tripped the hell outta me, fuck her) and I've been stuck at 117-120 kg ever since. But with lots of patience, I am now getting my life and finances back in order, slowly but surely. Still, I'm pretty sad about the state of things at the moment.\n\nI don't hate myself, nor do I feel ashamed for the binge. I'm just really sad, tired, stressed and generally bummed out right now \ud83d\ude22... i know, baby steps and all, but man. Today just really sucked.\n\nHeading to bed now, because I know tomorrow will be a new day.

The animation looks great, but I also hope that the horses have \"different gears\", not just galloping and speeding up. I've been way too spoiled by RDR (BEST horses in gaming, ever), but come on Nintendo! I believe in you!\n- The ability to pick up mushrooms, apples etc... from the back of your horse. Pleeease? That would kick so much butt!\n- Use the horse as a pack mule if necessary (maybe have the speed being affected the more you put on it or something? Although that's a stretch).\n- Different types of horses, not just in colour. We've seen the ponies the Bokoblins are riding on, which are probably unavailable for Link, but could there be other differences? \n\n- Random interlude: I hope you can ride the horse and have the wolf (or doggo \u2764\ufe0f) running after you. That would be so great!\n\nBack on topic:\n- Maybe own more than one horse? Although that's not really important to me.\n- FINALLY adding some stuff where you can \"upgrade\" the horse in various ways. Stuff like having to replace the horseshoes after a while, or maybe even minigames to improve the horses stamina, speed, health etc...\n- Different levels of horse accessories, like the above mentioned horseshoe for example: the first horseshoe has a pretty low durability and you'd need to find a better smith etc... Maybe even specialized horseshoes for travelling up glaciers? Just a thought.\n- Quest for Epona. Just like the green tunic probably being unavailable for a pretty long time or even being optional because of Nintendo's focus on customization/RPG, I would LOVE there to be an optional but challenging, bordering on tedious side-quest to get Epona, the fastest and strongest horse in the game. I want to be worthy of her, not just have her thrown at me!\n\nThis game honestly is a dream come true for me, and the above is wishful thinking at its best. Heck, I dreamt about our horse receiving giant wings after we help out Not-Falco xD! Pegapona? Eponus? My subconcious apparently couldn't contain the hype that night!\n\nBut more than anything, I would LOVE to know what you guys think! Are the horses important to you? What are your hopes? Please share, I would love to talk to like-mindes folks!\n\nHappy 2017 to everybody!
