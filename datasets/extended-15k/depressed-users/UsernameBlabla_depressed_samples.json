But I doubt they know what they are talking about, as they have difficulty discussing the word \"depression\" and stuff. I bet they only just googled the term last night.\n\nI'm not even sure I have depression because I can still feel joy, excitement and love (for my cat). It's not high functioning depression either.\nThe root cause of my depressed attitude is not because of a lack of SSRI, it's due to some other personal and family issues. At least I know that much.\n\nWhat's more, two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, but I knew that was not the case, and refused to take the meds they prescribed. Nothing happened. I didn't have such manic episodes like they said I would. \n\nSo I'm afraid they would give me another wrong diagnosis and prescription. I have heard some people suffer irreversible brain damage from ssri drugs. Some have migraine and dementia from antidepressant withdrawal. And I absolutely hate being force to dependent on drugs and listening to some guys that only care about money.\n(Yes, their services were terrible and only focused on keeping me stay to charge me more money. That's why I don't have much faith in the psychiatrists and their meds, at least in my country where mental illnesses are still a myth to most people.)\n\nTl;dr: My questions are: Do antidepressants really help? Do they have any side effects or consequences? Should I trust the \"experts\" and undergo treatment?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 393499, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My family is forcing me to go to psychiatrist and take meds.

The stars of the unit matter too.\nI did quite a lot of experiments and find out that a level 15 Battle Room (1\u2b50) sometimes give a lower percentage than a level 7 Betrayal Room (2\u2b50), so I'm not sure about picking the highest level unit to sacrifice anymore.\nBut sometimes a level 2 Giantify Room (3\u2b50) give the lowest enhancing percentage. So that means stars aren't the key either.\nI tried to take notes but the results were all over the place. There's no solid conclusion, so I have to bring it up here to ask if you have any information on this.\nSo far my best guess is the facility with highest level **and** most stars usually gives a higher enhancing percentage.\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DungeonMaker", "subreddit_id": "t5_jphnz", "subreddit_subscribers": 1027, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What's more important in facility enhancing: level or star?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonMaker/comments/9kfeba/whats_more_important_in_facility_enhancing_level/"}, {"author": "UsernameBlabla", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1527280084, "domain": "self.morbidquestions", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/morbidquestions/comments/8m4v84/is_fentanyl_a_painless_way_to_kill_oneself/", "id": "8m4v84", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/morbidquestions/comments/8m4v84/is_fentanyl_a_painless_way_to_kill_oneself/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1527280085, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I've heard about fentanyl overdose, and am just curious if it could actually lead to a painless death.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "morbidquestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_37wph", "subreddit_subscribers": 71637, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is fentanyl a painless way to kill oneself?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/morbidquestions/comments/8m4v84/is_fentanyl_a_painless_way_to_kill_oneself/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "UsernameBlabla", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525597284, "domain": "self.infj", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/8he232/staying_friends_with_an_infj_you_like/", "id": "8he232", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/infj/comments/8he232/staying_friends_with_an_infj_you_like/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1525597285, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infj", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r39a", "subreddit_subscribers": 30207, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Staying friends with an INFJ you like", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/8he232/staying_friends_with_an_infj_you_like/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
