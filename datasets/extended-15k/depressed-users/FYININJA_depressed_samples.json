Sad boi here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been depressed my whole life. I finally was more or less forced into doing something about it a few months ago. I self admitted to the hospital to avoid doing something highly regrettable. Psychiatrist there said I was depressed, but didn't recommend I take any medication, instead suggested I see a counselor (luckily for me, being a college student I get free counseling on campus). Counseling works pretty well, for a while. I make some progress,but ultimately things aren't getting easier, they're just getting less bad when they get bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this semester, and my counselor has to leave. This crushes me, as she was the first counselor that I was making progress with, and now I'm going to have to relive all the horrible experiences in my life if I want to make that same connection with another counselor. I don't really have a support group on campus. Not one that I can trust, anyways. I have very few close friends (I.E one), and they're too busy with their own life to help me out like they used too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to health services about possibly getting medication ,and the doctor wants me to go see a psychiatrist before they prescribe me medication. I attempt to get an appointment with a psychiatrist, and the closest appointments are MONTHS away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've really tried. I've done everything you're supposed to do. I self-admitted to the hospital. I went to counseling and took it seriously. I attempted to see a psychiatrist and get fully evaluated. None of it matters. I'm still depressed. I'm more depressed now than I was before this all began. I've had suicidal thoughts my whole life, but now they're overwhelming me at all hours of the day. I'll have a few good days, then have a few of the darkest days I've ever had. I can barely sleep, I do stupid things to make myself feel worse when I'm down. I've been skipping my classes and avoiding my work responsibilities. I don't know what else to do.

It'll randomize teams every map so that the random people aren't always put at a disadvantage of facing against a 6 man premade. I know you can use custom games for this, but it's inconvenient and often difficult to find people who want to play regular old Quick Play Overwatch in custom games. Yes, you can break the groups up into two potentially, but then you aren't likely to be playing alongside each other. Ideally we could play with a group of 10 ,for example, and it'd randomly assign us to teams. That way we can all play the normal quick play rules without having to resort to custom games. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a small suggestion that I think would be nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand there are a few potential problems. Firstly, trolling the randoms, but I feel like this is already something that is possible, and rarely happens. You can use the join game option to join a game and troll to help your friends if you really wanted too, but I don't think it's a valuable enough strategy in this game that people would want to do it. Secondly, exp farming (Joining quick play with a group of 12, and just win trading back and forth to get exp). I don't think this is really that big of a deal. At most you could make sure everybody gets a first win of the day, but if you randomize the teams each game, it wouldn't matter anyways, as it'd be far too much of a pain to keep rotating through until everyone gets one free win. Thirdly, it might make it annoying for the random people who might want to use voice chat, as odds are the people in that group are all in a voice chat application, so they might not join team chat to talk with the random. I don't think this is a huge deal, people don't use in game chat that often in quick play anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would be a nice change for larger communities who enjoy casually playing, but don't have a consistent group of 12 that they can jump into custom games with. It can also help recruit \"loners\" into larger groups. If you've got 11 people playing with a random person, that's a great chance to invite that random person into their group, which helps create larger and more accepting communities in Overwatch.

So a bit of background. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in my late 20's, and I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago. I had dealt with it my entire life, but I had never really handled it well. After dealing with the end of a relationship, I snapped and ended up self-admitting to the psych ward because I was unable to handle it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, things have gotten a lot worse. I came to college late, and this is now my sixth year in college. I went to get an associates degree, which I finished every class but 1 (without knowing). I had already applied and been accepted to a 4 year program by the time I found out that I needed one more class. So I'm 1 class away from having my associates. Anyways, I decided to go to a 4 year school, I had a job that made college relatively cheap, and it was a job I really enjoyed. Well, after 2 years in the program, I realized I was basically stuck. I kept taking and dropping the same two classes because around mid-term it became obvious I was not going to pass them. When I finally decided to go to counseling (Right before my mental breakdown), my counselor suggested I look into another major. So I picked up another major, and I'm having the same exact issue. I've also had a counselor I was very close with leave due to medical reasons, forcing me to try to get to know a new counselor. On top of that, I've had several appointments canceled due to emergencies, so I rarely get to go to counseling anyways. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also struggling more with my depression because I've been fighting it alone a lot more lately. When I had my break down, I had one friend I trusted with my mental health issues. She was a girl I cared about a lot, and we sort of...messed around with the idea of dating, but it never went anywhere. When she started a new relationship, it strained our friendship heavily. Now she's at the point where any time I try to vent to her, she just tells me I have to help myself, and rarely says anything else. My counselor suggested I reach out to other people, which I did, and for a while it went really well, but now those people have stopped being responsive. My friend used to be super sensitive toward me, and always said uplifting things, or invited me to do certain things, but since they've graduated and started a new relationship, they have virtually no time for me, or when they do, it's because they force themselves to make time for me. They still allow me to vent, but I've exhausted them to the point where they never try to say anything positive to cheer me up. It's always apologizing for how I feel, saying that it sucks, and trying to suggest I do this or that to make myself feel better. It's never anything positive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn relation to my job, I'm an RA on my college campus. I've been on campus for a while, and it's a pretty small campus. Long story short, a lot of people are aware of who I am. I'm known as the dude who has been at college forever. My bosses all preach constantly about coming to them for help when you're struggling with classes, but I couldn't bring myself too, and now I'm in this situation where dropping out is the only logical action, but if I drop out, I'm going to disappoint my family, my friends, and my supervisors at my only \"real\" job. I don't know if they'd refuse to give me a good recommendation, but I know they'll lecture me about how I should have done this, or I should have done that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now 6 years into college, at least 3 years away from getting a bachelors degree, and nothing else to show for it. I have virtually no friends, the ones I do have grown sick of me being depressed. My home life is awful, every time I go home I go into a deep depression, and my friends from high school all make things worse. I'm so terrified of dropping out because I don't want to move back home, but I also don't really have anywhere else to go. I have a vehicle, so I can potentially get a job, but my vehicle is in really bad shape, and I don't live in an area where public transit is really an option to get to work. I feel like I have no options. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what I want to hear, but I just needed to vent. I needed people to understand and care, because right now it feels like nobody in my life really cares.

She's a cool character, much in the same way that Arthas was a cool character. However, she's being completely wasted. \n\nAs somebody who leans more toward Horde, it's disappointing to have another leader going full psycho, and I think almost everyone is in agreement about that, but I'm as or more disappointed that her character is being completely ruined because Blizzard is trying to write around her being Warchief. \n\nShe could be a really interesting villain, her crusade against life could be a really interesting counterpart to the whole Light Vs Void theme the game is going toward, and it would add a potential raid/raid boss that wouldn't be an old god, or corrupted by an old god, or corrupted by the light (she could also be a focus of an expansion alongside Bolvar potentially, adding a conflict that isn't faction oriented). Just a good old fashioned villain, threatening enough on her own that she needs to be dealt with, but not necessarily the main villain of an expansion. Her motives are fine for a villain, but completely fucking stupid for somebody who is supposed to be a faction leader leading people like Saurfang and Baine. It's basically ruining the storyline for the entire Horde, but it's also making her seem less threatening because she's working alongside a bunch of people who clearly don't agree with her. They're not scared though, or if they are following her out of fear, they're doing a shitty job of showing it. \n\nSo with this dumbass direction they're going with this, they're more or less ruining a character that otherwise could be a pretty cool, interesting villain, they're repeating a storyline from Cata/MoP in that \"Horde leader = bad guy\", and they're pissing off Horde players. At this point, I don't see any reasonable way she could be redeemed without sacrificing everything that makes her interesting, so we can't even go that way. Her crusade on the living is interesting, and could be fleshed out much more if she wasn't allied with a faction that is 90% living allies. Her plaguedoctors are a hugely threatening foe, and could be utilized much more aggressively if she wasn't a faction leader. They were enough to scare the most badass villain the game has away, but she can't use them properly because she's a part of a faction that is supposed to be honorable. By disconnecting her from the Horde that restriction is no longer there. \n\nI don't really see any reasonable way out of this dumb hole they've dug themselves into. Redeeming her removes her interesting character traits, and all of this faction war shit was completely pointless if she gets redeemed even just in the eyes of the Horde. If she doesn't get redeemed, Blizzard has to either try to find a way to justify why the Orcs, Tauren, Trolls, Nightbourne, Blood Elves, pandaren, etc would still work with her despite the fact she literally wants to kill them, or ignore it entirely and ruin the storyline of the entire faction until she is destroyed at some point. If she's just killed, then it leaves a permanent mark on the Horde storyline as a whole. No matter what they do in the future, there's always this period where they were completely cool following a Banshee Queen who wanted them all to die (Despite not wanting to die themselves), and they never tried to overthrow her. If they overthrow her again, they're repeating a storyline almost exactly. \n\nThis is basically just a rant, but this is just something that I don't see a lot of people mentioning. Sylvanas has always been a pretty controversial character, at least since Wrathgate, and I think a lot of that problem isn't Sylvanas herself, it's her connection to the Horde. She jumps from \"Oh well maybe I can be the leader the horde needs!\" to \"ALL THE LIVING MUST DIE\", and nobody on the Horde in-universe seems to give a shit. If her plan all along was to use the Horde as a tool to get to her goal, it's far too late to reveal that without it being a lazy repeat of Garrosh's storyline. I like Sylvanas as a character, and I think if she had been kicked out of the Horde, and the Forsaken had gotten a new leader a while ago, she could have been a really cool, super threatening villain. Instead, we're getting the worst of all situations.

So, for the last few years, I got really close to somebody with BPD. Before becoming friends, I didn't even know BPD was a thing, but over time I learned about it. We got very very close, spending almost all of our time together. We eventually sorta \"tried\" to date. Well, long story short, things didn't work out, and I had a mental breakdown. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, and our friendship has been strained to the point where I'm not sure if it will ever recover. I got really upset because they were reading my messages and not responding, so I threatened to block them (Yeah I know, far from the best course of action), we ended up not talking for a few weeks. We started up talking again, and things were okay for a few days, but then they suggested I watch a movie, and due to the nature of the movie (and our \"sorta\" relationship), it really upset me, so I threatened to block them again. We had a long discussion about our friendship, but I feel like we didn't make any progress. At the end of it, they told me that \"this is why they'll never have a healthy friendship\", and it just killed me. I promised I'd block them on all social media to avoid the temptation to reach out to them since they didn't want to talk to me. \n\nI guess what I want to know is, is there a way for me to determine if this friendship is just over or not? I tried to get pretty good at trying to identify issues that might be caused by BPD, but I'm worried that this friendship is now completely done. \n\nThere's a lot more going on with this, but I guess I want to know from people with BPD, should I reach out to this friend? The friendship as was was unhealthy for both of us. However, I feel like it could return to being a healthy friendship again, but I'm worried she'll never reach out to me even if she feels the need too. \n\nI really care about her, and she's had a lot of trouble maintaining friendships before, and I think she's a really great person. I just don't want to violate my promise to message her if she doesn't want me too.

I don't play comp that much. I just like to play quick play, but I like to have balanced games. Comp is stressful, and the pressure to win is really high, so I avoid it because I don't like the atmosphere of comp. Anyways, that's not the point of this post. I understand the atmosphere for comp is going to be inherently more serious than quick play. However, when it comes to quick play, I think Blizzard tries way too hard to find quick and easy matches, instead of trying to find matches that are even slightly balanced. I realize quick play MMR and comp SR are going to be pretty drastically different sometimes, but Overwatch is at it's most fun when everybody is contributing toward a win.\n\nFor me personally, quick play has become a series of one team steamrolling the other (typically because one or more players on the other team are dramatically higher SR than the other team). It's not fun, and it's impossible to play with many of my friends because our comp SR is so dramatically different, and when we play quick play it just tosses us into a game with random opponents. Even when I play only with friends of similar SR, it still ends up being a complete mess. \n\nI don't know a solution, but if you gave an option to \"prefer more evenly matched games (Will increase queue times) in the options, I would gladly check that.

The path to the end point should be marked with 'O' characters. \n\nOne issue I'm running into is drawing 'O' characters when the maze moves forward. Sometimes it works properly, and other times it just doesn't. I've tried adding a O right before each recursive call, I've tried adding it after, and I've tried adding it to the start of the function. Sometimes it works as I would expect, but many times it will draw a single O, then give me a true/false output.\n\nSecondly, and probably more importantly, I'm completely lost as to how I would go about \"backing out\" of a dead end. One of the example inputs for the program involves a maze where you have to go past a dead end that your function will attempt to enter. My function enters the dead end as I would expect, but I don't understand how to fix that, even on a conceptual level. I've thought about creating another conditional statement for if you run into a dead in (surrounded by wall on 3 sides and \"path\" on the other\", but I don't see how I could back out of it multiple times. \n\nFor example, if you've entered a dead end hallway that is 4 blocks deep, I don't see how you could have the function back out 4 steps and try a different direction. Ending the function would be pointless as it would run up the path again.\n\nThanks for the help!\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cpp_questions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tdbd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help writing a recursive function to solve a maze.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/6zbmke/help_writing_a_recursive_function_to_solve_a_maze/"}, {"author": "FYININJA", "author_flair_css_class": "C03 R07", "author_flair_text": "Chibi Pharah", "brand_safe": true, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1495767079, "domain": "self.Overwatch", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/6dec7a/blizzard_please_look_at_qp_matchmaking_the/", "id": "6dec7a", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "f", "link_flair_text": "News &amp; Discussion", "locked": false, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Overwatch/comments/6dec7a/blizzard_please_look_at_qp_matchmaking_the/", "retrieved_on": 1497180714, "score": 6, "selftext": "I've made multiple posts about this, and I plan on doing it over and over until I get some sort of response.\n\nI'm currently Diamond ranked, but I've climbed to low master a few times. I play QP around as seriously as I play competitive, so being generous to myself, I'm probably high diamond QP MMR. When I solo queue, I typically play with other master/diamond level players, and a few GM players occasionally.\n\nWhen I play with friends who are lower ranked, we ALWAYS get matched against multiple GM/Master/Diamond level players, even if every single teammate of mine is below platinum. \n\nIt's to the point where I literally can't get my friends to play Overwatch with me, because they don't have fun. It's not fun for gold/silver players to get spawn camped by master/diamond level players in a 6 man premade. Despite my win-rate dropping like a rock, there appears to be absolutely no difference whatsoever in my MMR, as this happens every time, regardless of who I queue with. Teams of all silver and below? At least a few master players. Teams of a few diamonds and a few below plat? At least one GM player along with 1-2 master and the rest diamonds. \n\nIt's killed their enthusiasm to play the game. Some of them aren't even high enough level to play ranked, and have no desire to play because they don't want to solo queue. They only want to play with friends, but feel like they're the worst players alive because they're being matched against the top 10% of players, despite not even knowing half the character's names. Some of them are people who have played literally thousands of hours of other games with me, with similar skill discrepancies, but haven't had to deal with matchmaking that is so awful so consistently. \n\nI'm begging you Blizzard. I love this game, I really do, but I cannot enjoy it if I have to play by myself because my friends refuse to play with me. I'm not willing to go into quick play solo and ruin it for my teammates to throw matches until my MMR is at a more reasonable level, I'm not going to spend 40 bucks on this game a second time just so I can play with my friends. There is no excuse for a game this popular to have so much trouble finding matches for somebody outside of the top 5%. It's completely ridiculous. With as many people there are who play this game, it should not be throwing GM players into games where half the team is under silver, unless the other half of that team happens to be at that level. It destroys their self confidence and enjoyment of the game. It ruins their win rate, makes them feel awful, and kills their desire to want to improve at the game, because what's the point if \"everybody who plays this game\" is so good. \n\n\nWith competitive having a skill-gate (which I agree with 100%), quick play and arcade are our only options. If we want to play somewhat seriously, quick play is the only remotely viable option, but there's no point trying to take it seriously because the level of play between the two teams is ridiculous. \n\nTL;DR-\nBronze, Bronze, <25, gold, Diamond, Diamond getting matched against Master, Master, Master, Diamond, Diamond, Plat in QP.

My friends tend to be...pretty bad. They're low ranked, or not high enough to even play ranked yet.\n\nTypically, in other games, (Namely League), games still managed to be pretty even, even if we weren't very close in skill level.\n\nOverwatch has been absolutely horrendous, though. Our group of 5 (Me, at low diamond MMR), 3 of them at less than 1000 SR, and one who was unranked, was matched against THREE MASTER/GM players in a premade of 6.\n\nI thought it was just a one time thing, but the very next game was all diamond ranked people. Needless to say, every game is an absolute stomp. It's to the point where they don't enjoy playing the game. They will rarely play the game because they can't play with me, and they don't like to play with me because every game is a shitshow. Even when we've lost several in a row, it puts us against teams where the games are a complete stomp in the other direction.\n\nIf you're wanting new people to get the game, matchmaking needs to make games fun and balanced. Right now it doesn't even try. It's to the point where these people who have played similar games like TF2 or League for 1000's of hours, can't stand playing Overwatch for more than an hour because it's loss after loss after loss. \n\nI realize part of the problem is my ranking, but there's no way there aren't 4 silver level players and a diamond/master level playing individually in all of Overwatch. Perhaps my QP MMR is just super duper high, but with the number of losses we've been dealing with lately, it should be declining pretty rapidly until games are somewhat balanced, but it doesn't appear anything at all is happening. The absolute closest games we've been facing are games of 4-5 diamond level players (aside from the occasional game where we go against a bunch of low level players), and those are still absolute destruction due to the vast difference in skill between bronze/silver and diamond. \n\nIt's hard to convince them that they can improve at the game and enjoy it, when every game they're going against people far more experienced and just plain better at it. \n\nI'm just curious if it's just me, or if this is a problem with anybody else of somewhat high rank, trying to play with bad/new friends?

It's basically just a flavor passive that sometimes can help him pick up a few kills in super niche situations. \n\nHow about instead of having that passive, they give him a new one. \n\nDemolition- Junkrat's explosives ignore all damage resistance on enemies.

It'd also help his ult. His ult could become a way to counteract Nano pushes. In areas such as first point Hanamura on defense, knowing that Junkrat's riptire is around the corner as Ana nano's, might stall out the push barring stuff like Zarya bubble/Lucio ult. \n\nIf this turns out to make him too powerful, they can balance his kit around it, though I honestly feel like he'd still be weak, but he'd have a niche beyond spamming around corners and hoping an enemy happens to mess up.

However, I'm really surprised Capcom haven't capitalized on the newer trend of mobile games. \n\nI'm relatively new to the...\"genre\", but if you haven't played Fire Emblem: Heroes, or DBZ Dokkan Battle, they're both mobile games, and while Heroes is much less of a \"card game\", Dokkan Battle is sort of a digital collectible card game.\n\nThe reason I bring them up, is that...literally any or all of the megaman game universes are practically begging for this type of game. \n\nIn a nutshell, the games have some sort of pretty basic game mechanic. For DBZ Dokkan Battle you make a team of 6 characters by collecting \"cards\" of varying rarities. You fight other characters by matching orbs, it's really a simple game. FE:H is a bit more complex in terms of game mechanics, but still nothing huge. Both of these games make absolutely massive amounts of money despite simplistic game mechanics.\n\nCapcom could create one of these games...pretty easily, and it'd be a great way to capitalize on the popularity of Megaman, release a new game, and generate insane amounts of income, if done properly.\n\nI'll use the Battle Network series, since it lends itself to this type of game the best, though honestly all of the games have enough characters where you could feasibly have this type of game, or they could easily make one big giant Megaman Franchise game, and use characters from all of the franchises.\n\nBasically- You'd have some sort of underlying game mechanic. A turn-based style similar to Megaman Battle Network could be fine. You pick a character or a few characters, they have certain abilities, stats, probably some sort of \"typing triangle\", and most importantly, rarities. You gain characters by \"summoning\" them. When summoning, you have a certain chance to get characters of various rarities. I.E a normal rarity would be trash mobs. Mettaurs, etc. Rare cards might be slightly more significant or end game enemies, possibly mini bosses. These characters more or less only exist to dillute the \"card pool\" so that you can't effortlessly get all the cards you want quickly. There would be some sort of method to trade them in for currency, to make other units more powerful, etc. Then you'd have your super rares and above. These would be net navis. Typically you'd have your less significant net navis be super rare. Fireman.exe, for example, would be a SR. These cards would be ones you want, but not game defining. They could be upgraded, leveled up, etc. Potentially they could be upgraded to a higher rarity, etc. SSR's or UR's or LR's or whatever higher rarity you want would be big time navis. Megaman.exe, Bass.exe, Protoman.exe, end game bosses, these characters would be super rare but super super strong. \n\nThere would be like 15 fucking in game currencies because that's how these games work. You'd have one \"big\" currency, which you can buy, or earn by completing in game missions/levels/etc. These can be used to refill other currencies, \"summon\" new characters, etc. This is the moneymaker, so you'd have to limit how players can get them, and encourage them to \"hoard\" them, so that they'll be more likely to purchase some, particularly with new content. \n\nOther currencies could be used for other things, such as buying boosts for characters, buying specific characters, upgrading characters, etc. \n\nAfter the underlying core game mechanic is finished, these games are unbelivably simple to keep up to date and keep generating money. All you need are artist to draw the art for new characters, and a fresh stream of new characters to add. You can also go the DBZ route and add events to upgrade certain characters. Make it super difficult so people want to buy more currency, and that encourages people who have favorite characters (If you love Fireman.exe, you might be willing to spend money getting the required items to upgrade him to make him competitively viable with other characters).\n\nI'm aware these kind of games are pretty divisive. They're basically gambling, as statistically, you're pretty unlikely to get specific characters you like, but they are absolutely perfect for the mobile market, and Megaman is a series with a metric shitton of characters to add over time, and clearly Capcom want to get money for as little effort as possible. Hopefully if it becomes enough of a cash cow, a new game release could be justified as a glorified advertisement for the new game (If they release a Megaman Battle Network 7, then they can add tons of new characters to the game). I enjoy these types of games, and don't mind sinking some money into them because I'm a sucker for collecting characters from franchises I adore. Megaman would fit the bill so well, and Capcom doesn't seem interested in doing anything else with the character.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Megaman", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rq0l", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So with the release of Fire Emblem: Heroes, and the prevalance of games like DBZ Dokkan Battle, how have Capcom not capitalized on the mobile market properly?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/5uqnlx/so_with_the_release_of_fire_emblem_heroes_and_the/"}, {"author": "FYININJA", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1480466779, "domain": "self.cpp_questions", "edited": 1480468279, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/5fmi30/unable_to_tell_why_a_function_is_skipping_the/", "id": "5fmi30", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "open", "link_flair_text": "OPEN", "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/cpp_questions/comments/5fmi30/unable_to_tell_why_a_function_is_skipping_the/", "retrieved_on": 1484287901, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, as part of a program I'm working on in a class, we're supposed to read in from a file, and find a few things from the file it's reading in.

I've taken a few programming classes in high school, mostly stuff involving visual basic and a random pascal class.\n\nAnyways, we recently got a project for our class, where we are supposed to take a few inputs, perform calculations, and get output. We're also supposed to use almost only functions to perform the calculations (I.E main is basically only supposed to be function calls).\n\nAnyways, while typing up this program, I managed to finally get it to compile, but I'm not able to make any sense of the output I'm receiving. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\t\tint getData(int startH, int startM, char amPm, int delayH, int delayM)\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t\tcout << \"Insert Hours, minutes, and a or p. Insert 999 for hours to end \";\n\t\t\tcin >> startH >> startM >> amPm;\n\n\t\t\tcout << \"Insert the delay hours and minutes \";\n\t\t\tcin >> delayH >> delayM;\n\n\t\treturn(startH, startM, amPm, delayH, delayM);\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is where I'm gathering input from the user. They're supposed to enter in a time (2 30 p), then a delay time (2 30) (He's specifically told us to not be overly specific on the formatting of the output, merely to worry about the calculations). Anyways, after the prompt, I'll put in the above examples for input, but right after that function in the main program, I placed a cout to check and see if the cin put the appropriate variables into everything, and I'm getting completely random numbers that don't make any sense to me. \n\nI placed a cout \n\ncout << startH << \" \" << startM << \" \" << amPm << \" \" << delayH << \" \" << delayM;\n\nand upon entering in 2 30 p for the first input, and 2 30 for the second, I get\n\n4313352 0  256 101287539228753924342380287539228753924342380\n\nI'm finding it difficult to work on calculating anything else because these values are so horrifically off and I'm not entirely sure why. I can show you other functions, but I'm pretty sure the problem is before any of the calculations.

It starts off with an insanely chilling trial, combined with several hugely significant characters dying off on a dramatic way. It has the massive power play on behalf of Cersei doing something dramatic to get what she wants, but of course Cersei can't just \"win\", she lost the last thing she cared for. It has a bit of the politics, notably in the North involving Jon, another power play with Littlefinger attempting to court Sansa, a huge (albeit far from surprising) revelation from Bran. We had sweet, sweet revenge with Arya, plotting for revenge with Olenna and the Sand Snakes, Varys arranging things as Varys does, and a finishing shot of a massive army setting up the next season.\n\nIt's really the perfect ending to a season of Game of Thrones. The two episodes combined are everything you want from Game of Thrones. Whether you watch it for the politics, the drama, the battles, the fantasy elements, the directing, the musical score, no matter what you want, one of those two episodes had it. A great sendoff, and while I'm optimistic that they'll be able to top it, I do worry they set the bar insanely high for future episodes.

During the closed beta, Widow wasn't nearly as prevalent as she is now, so I didn't even think twice about her kit being really really stupid. \n\nNow though, every time I go on a winning streak (I typically hover around 60% win rate), it's ALWAYS stopped by a team with a good Widowmaker. Every time. I know her counters, I know Winston, D.Va, and sometimes Genji can handle even a good Widowmaker. The problem is, her kit doesn't make her \"countered\" nearly as hard as other characters.\n\nIf your team is getting wrecked by an agressive Winston, you can go reaper and swing the game. If your team is getting destroyed by a Symmetra, you can go Winston and handle her easily. If a Pharah is destroying your team, going Soldier means you can pretty easily handle her. \n\nThis game has a lot of HARD counters. Like, super hard, but Widowmaker doesn't have that right now. Winston, D.Va, and Genji typically just cause her to grapple to her teammates, assuming she's not close enough that Winston/D.Va/Genji die before they can reach her. \n\nThere's a lot of suggested nerfs, but I just don't think she'll ever really be balanced. She scales entirely too much with skill compared to every other character in the game. One of my favorite things about this game is that all the characters are inherently simple. Even Tracer/Genji are pretty simple to be effective with with just a little practice, but Widowmaker becomes dramatically more effective the better you are.\n\nThe thing is, I don't think she needs nerfs. The fact that at the competitive level there were players using hacks, and they still weren't able to steamroll, means that Widowmaker clearly isn't broken. That's a huge issue IMO, and why I don't think she needs nerfs as much as flat out changes.\n\nShe's kinda...the anti-Bastion. Bastion needs changes because he's so easily countered, and once you reach a certain point in your Overwatch knowledge, he becomes trivial to deal with. Widowmaker is trivial to deal with, until she reaches a point where she becomes horrible to deal with. \n\nIt's just...there's been such a massive shift from closed beta to now. I'm not sure if it's just hackers (it could be, but i doubt it, unless they're super prevalent at remotely high MMR matches). Pre closed beta it was something I had to deal with every few games, now if I win more than 2 in a row, every single game becomes determined by Widowmakers. It could be the exodus of Counter Strike players coming over, who just happen to be really good at sniping, and climb into high MMR matches by virtue of being really good. It's funny to see a game with players level 80-100, then a widowmaker on either team that's level 15 on fire through the whole game.

While I enjoyed the movie, I tried to think of things that would fight pretty evenly with a T-Rex, when I remembered another pretty awesome CGI-heavy movie involving a certain gorilla beating the shit out of T-Rex's.\n\nFor those of you not in the know, Indominus Rex is a genetically altered Dinosaur. It has a number of different dinosaurs contributing to it's makeup, but the most obvious is the T-Rex (which gives it size). It's similar in size to the T-Rex, but has far larger hands which are capable of actually grabbing objects. It can change it's skin color to camouflage, and it's VERY intelligent. It faked an escape to trick humans into entering it's cage to investigate. It's very powerful, capable of flipping a jeep with one hand (and not just moving it, literally tossing it into the air). In terms of durability, while it did get damaged by bullets, it survived a pretty close blast from a RPG (though not a direct hit IIRC). It got shot by a variety of bullets and was not visibly damaged. \n\nOn the other side, you have King Kong. Intelligent and powerful, his fight scenes with the T-Rex's in the modern movie showcased his insane brutality. Able to tear a T-Rex's jaw apart, and fight with 4 limbs, he was able to handle multiple assailants, while at the same time protecting his human prisoner. \n\nRound 1- A standard brawl in an empty Arena. No trees, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.\n\nRound 2- Forest Brawl, both attackers start out on opposite sides of the arena. \n\nRound 3- City- Old timey New York City. They start off on the same street. \n\nRound 4- Hunting (Forest), both are hunting the other, who is aware they are being hunted, and have time to hide. Are they able to successfully hunt their prey? If they both win, who does it faster.

His body is in a constant state of decay, his skin rots away, many of his bones are visible, and he has a visible \"aura\" of stench. \n\n**Story-** Kotci was diagnosed with an extremely devastating disease from birth. Born in the city of Zaun, naturally the first thing they wish to do is study him. Singed, along with several other scientist, devised a concoction that allowed the infant to live, but also allowed his disease to stay active. Ideally, Zaun wanted to find out how to weaponize this virus, using it to gas entire cities and destroy everything with ease. Unforutnately for Zaun, despite many years of study, they were unable to find a way to remove any portion of the virus from the child. It seemed attached to him, and could only be spread through direct contact. Many Zaun prisoners were killed as they attempted to spread the virus to more suitable host that could be used as living weapons, but none were able to survive the virus in the way the boy could. Either they would be cured of it, or no amount of chemicals would save them. Kotci was an enigma. Eventually, Zaun decided the only way to weaponize this incredibly potent disease was to weaponize the boy himself. From a young age they instilled a since of pride of Zaun into him. He grew up thinking of Zaun as his saviors, treating Singed especially as a father, ignorant of the fact that he could have been cured many years ago. \n\nThere's obviously more places his storyline could go. He could learn of Zaun's true intentions, perhaps from Zac, he could grow into one of Zaun's most powerful creations, etc. \n\n**Role-** Kotci's main role would be a bottom lane support, in the style of Lulu. Super agressive early, with some potent slows and CC to protect his allies.\n\n\n**Passive-** Viral Personality- While a damage over time effect is active on a nearby enemy champion, the pestilence mage gains (X)% increased mana regeneration. This effect can stack up to five times, and applies to all DoTs, not just his own. \n\n**Q-** Dismantle - The caster takes his own limb off and tosses it in a line. Enemies hit are posioned, taking (X) damage, poisioning them for another (X) damage over 5 seconds. (Scales off AP) At the end of it's range if it connects with an enemy champion, it grabs them, rooting them in place for (X) seconds, and dealing double damage.  Rather long cooldown, low mana cost. (It works kinda similar to a fizz ult, in that you can throw it any distance you want, except that it doesn't stop when it hits somebody, and instead only roots the person in the \"stopping\" point. Another way to look at it would be similar to a Lux E, except it does damage on it's path to the targeted area, and only CC's people in the final spot.)\n\nAlternatively- The caster takes his limb off, tossing it into the air. If it hits no enemies, the limb explodes, dealing damage over time to all enemies within it's radius. (Small radius). If it lands on an enemy, it grabs them, dealing double the damage over the same amount of time, while also rooting them to the ground for (X) seconds. (Shorter cooldown, higher mana cost, more overall damage). \n\n**W-** Immunize- Shields the target ally of (X) Damage. If the shield breaks, it spreads pestilence to nearby enemies, infecting them, dealing damage equal to the health of the shield. This damage is spread out over 5 seconds, dealing 75% of the total damage over the first 2.5 seconds, and the remaining 25% over the last 2.5. After being cast, Immunize can be cast again up to 4 times in quick succession. Each cast increases the mana cost by (X)%. Additional shields on the same ally during the duration are decreased in effectiveness by 25%, and cannot be stacked. (Think of a Pre-Rework Xerath ult for this. You cast it once, and it has several stacks. It doesn't go onto cooldown until the stacks are used up, or after a few seconds. The shield cannot stack, so ideally you'd want to use it after they pop the shield. Less useful for stopping harass early since it would have a rather long cooldown, but great in teamfights and longer engages since the total of the shield would be rather high. Can also be used to shield multiple allies, even if they aren't next to each other.)\n\n**E-** Pestilence- Tosses a vial at the targeted enemy, dealing (X)damage. Auto attacking the enemy after landing this will shatter the vial, dealing extra damage and slowing them. Low cooldown, high mana cost. If another vial is shattered before the effect wears off, the slow and damage is doubled, and the duration is refreshed. Can stack up to three times. Mana cost increases if used repeatedly, up to 5 times the base mana cost. (pestilence mage's auto attack range is shorter than Pestilence's range, making it so spamming it at max range is a bad idea) Pestilence is moderately strong at one stack, but after two or more stacks it deals significant damage, while also applying a rather significant slow. With three stacks it deals very high damage even without AP, and also slows very hard. Ideally, your Q would be up to allow you to easily keep refreshing the damage, though your Q is also useful for starting the spam. (This one isn't super complicated, it's a targeted ability. You click on the enemy, you stop for a moment to throw a vial. Once it hits, if you auto attack them, it \"explodes\" dealing damage and slowing. Successive \"burst\" will increase the effect of the attack. It has long range, low cooldown, but a high mana cost, and spamming it without breaking the vial would be very costly in the long run.)\n\n**R-** Fall Apart- Kotci's disease advances quickly. He falls to pieces, becoming untargetable. An aura appears around him. Enemies near his body are slowed by (X)%, decreasing by (X)% as they get further away. The cloud deals (X) damage to all enemies. It also debuffs all enemies inside the cloud. The debuff causes healing to be reduced by 50% ,and all healing received by enemies by lifesteal, spell vamp, or healing spells is also transferred to Kotci. \n\n(This works similarly to a Vlad ultimate, except you are unable to move. However, it provides a very powerful debuff that makes heal-intensive champs work against themselves.)\n\n**Discussion-**\n\nI envisioned Kotci when people were talking about how they missed old Trundle's design. League doesn't have really any \"gross\" champions. League also is kinda lacking in child champions. Kotci fits both of these roles. In addition, I like the whole \"Fighting for Zaun/Noxus even though they're evil, simply because he thinks they saved them\" deal. \n\nAs for gameplay, I tried to be somewhat unique with all of his spells. His Q is sorta unique, in that unlike a Morg root it can be used to target a specific person, but unlike a Zyra root it doesn't just root everybody outright. His W would be really hard to balance realistically, but I like the idea of a shield that can be spread across your teammates, and one that punishes enemies for breaking it. The damage wouldn't be very significant, because killing somebody for breaking a shield kinda puts players in a bad position, but with all of the shields breaking he could potentially put out some high damage. The DoT is mainly to assist him with his passive. His E is sorta like a Lux passive, except it also applies a slow. I envision him sitting in a bush, tossing vials and auto attacking if they get too close. It makes his teamfight more interesting as well, since unlike a lot of supports, he's encouraged to auto attack as well as casting spells (since most supports only auto attack because it does damage). His ultimate is an idea I've always really liked, in that he \"steals\" healing. Rather than something like a Kat ult that simply makes healing weaker, this one makes healing weaker along with healing you. Against somebody like Mundo, or a late game ADC with lots of lifesteal, if you land your ultimate Kotci suddenly becomes super difficult to 1v1, yet auto attacking anybody else will mean he'll stay at full health anyways. It makes heal-intensive champs think about what they are doing, rather than just healing any time somebody takes damage. \n\nAs for builds, Mana regen would be pretty important, as I envision him having extremely high mana cost, to offset his Pestielence and shield. His passive helps with his mana, but due to the fact that he needs mana to initially proc his abilities (therefore giving him more mana regen), if he's low on mana without a mana regen item, he's as useless as any other champ with mana. Beyond chalice, he could go for a tankier build (Spirit Visage in particular works well with his ultimate, though rushing it probably isn't a great idea as support), rushing in with his ultimate to debuff the enemy team, or he could go for a more cooldown/AP focused build, using his pestilence to deal heavy damage, and lower cooldowns allow his Q to be up more often, since it's a useful tool for catching sneaky ADCs that hang out behind tanks.

It's only really fun to play with a select few classes, (I.E Demo, Sniper, Medic, with some other classes sprinkled in.) Every time i play it, the top players on both teams are usually Demo/Huntsman sniper, with other classes all the way at the bottom.\n\nso I decided to take it upon myself to make a few weapon ideas, so other classes could potentially have niches/roles that would be fun and interesting. I was also trying to keep the weapons at least not game breaking in normal play, though they might not be the most useful, they shouldn't be stupidly overpowered in normal play either. I'm not using exact numbers, just rough ideas on the power they have. \n\nFirst up, Soldier. \n\nSoldier- The Soldier's main \"Niche\" in TF2 is his...all aroundness. He has high mobility, strong damage, very good health, etc. \n\nIn medieval mode, Soldier has...basically no use. He can use the escape plan/equalizer, or the whip to help teammates out, but it's a far cry from making him a viable alternative.\n\nRocket Launcher Replacement- Javelin-\nThe Javelin is a thrown weapon, like the cleaver. The Javelin has a pretty quick speed, though it's more than possible to dodge it at most ranges. It deals more damage the further it is thrown, at close range it does little damage, at max range it can nearly one shot low hp classes. The Javelin penetrates the first target it hits, allowing it to hit a second target, causing it to minicrit. It also pins people to walls. \nthe Javelin has a second function as well, if aimed at the ground, the soldier pole-vaults into the air, acting as a sort of rocket jump. This allows him to use the market gardener and mantreads. \n\nRole- This would keep the soldier as a sort of \"all around\" class. The javelin wouldn't be as powerful as the huntsman, but it'd be more versatile, since you can potentially hit multiple enemies with it. The jump in particular would allow soldiers to utilize the market gardener for  crits. In normal play, the javelin would merely be a fun alternative to the soldier's normal weapons. It would allow him to have \"damage free\" rocket jumping, at the cost of...rockets. \n\nPyro- The pyros main purpose in TF2 was initially close range damage + mobility. The pyro could deal pretty solid damage, while also moving around rather quickly. The pyro was also an expert at hunting down spies. Later on, the Airblast eventually became a critical part of the Pyros kit, causing him to funciton also as a \"support\" class. In medieval mode, the pyro's rake is pretty strong, but it doesn't make him stand out as anything other than a pure melee class. \nFlamethrower replacement- Fire Starter- \nThe Firestarter, despite what its name implies, doesn't start fires. It is, however, good for lengthening fires, and airblasting. Unlike the flamethrowers, the Fire starter doesn't utilize ammo, it instead has a rather short cooldown. Using it's primary fire, the pyro unleashes a blast of air, which can reflect projectiles and send enemies into the air. Additionally, if it hits an enemy who is already on fire, it deals damage and refreshes the flames. The firestarter would give the pyro a niche, and would give the Volcano shard a powerful compliement in medieval mode. \n\nShotgun Replacement- Greek Fire- \nGreek fire is a thrown object, like the cleaver. Upon hitting an enemy, the greek fireball deals slight damage, and slows the enemy for a few seconds. For the next 10 seconds, if the enemy is ignited by any means, they explode, causing them to ignite and take significant damage, along with lighting all nearby allies on fire. This gives the pyro a further niche. The volcanic shard +  Greek Fire gives him a combo similar to puff + sting. Huntsman snipers can also light enemies on fire, allowing for a longer range ignition. \n\nrole- This would give the pyro something more interesting than rake carrying terrorizer. The Firestarter would give him the same airblast utility he normally has. It has a cooldown, so in normal play it wouldn't really be effective for \"Airblast spamming\", but in degroot it would let him keep that utility (and allow for reflecting arrows/other thrown objects). The greek fire would allow the pyro to have a psudo ignite + axe combo, except instead of being rewarded for igniting, you'll be rewarded for axing. \n\nEngineer- The engineer's main job has always been area denial. His sentry provides a huge deterrent for the enemy team, and his dispenser/teleporter give his allies a means to get to the battlefield quickly, and allow him to more easily heal. \n\nBuilding replacements- \nTrebuchet- Sentry replacement. The Trebuchet is a small crossbow like device. It takes a few seconds to \"wind up\", once fully wound, the engineer can melee the trebuchet to fire it. The trebuchet locks onto the nearest target, and will follow it until it fires. The bolt can be dodged, but is very fast, so enemies not aware of it will have a difficult time dodging it, especially slowing moving classes like the heavy. \nCampfire- Dispenser replacement- The campfire works similarly to a dispenser. Standing next to it as an ally will heal you over time. Instead of dispensing ammo, however, the Campfire does a number of additonal things. Firstly, it causes all \"cooldown\" based items (such as the cleaver) to have increased reload speed. If a cooldown is normally 5 seconds, while you are standing next to the campfire, it will only take 2.5 seconds to recharge. This effect only works while standing within range of the campfire. Addtionally, the campfire can be used to light huntsman arrows. \nCatapault- Teleporter replacement- The Catapault is a little...different from the teleporter. The catapault will take some time to \"charge\", and when ready, standing atop the catapault will send you flying through the air. The catapault's arc can be changed by the engie without picking it up, so he can adjust the catapault mid round to head toward certain points. Teammates using the catapault do not take fall damage.\n\nrole- The engie's role would be different than normal, since there aren't as many choke points in degroot, he would be a more...up front class. His campfire would be good for scouts/soldiers, as they could toss then run back to the campfire to get another throwable more quickly. The trebuchet could be used for defending the final point, or putting it on the wall would allow for you to kill people as they head for the other points. The important thing to note is that if you keep moving, you'll probably be alright (since killing it would be a lot more difficult in Degroot). The catapult would be a more \"lulzy\" way to get allies to points more quickly. \n\nSo yeah, anybody else have any ideas? I think degroot is a potentially fun alternative, but right now it's just demoknight/sniper archer + some wacky alternative people. \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "tf2", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some weapon ideas for medieval mode?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/25dyuu/some_weapon_ideas_for_medieval_mode/"}, {"author": "FYININJA", "author_flair_css_class": "0324", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1398741489, "domain": "self.whowouldwin", "edited": 1398743369, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/248x04/zero_megaman_zero_vs_link_legend_of_zelda/", "id": "248x04", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/248x04/zero_megaman_zero_vs_link_legend_of_zelda/", "retrieved_on": 1441559570, "score": 8, "selftext": "Alright, so I'm sure there are at least a few people here who aren't 100% familiar with Zero from MMZ, but this matchup is actually pretty \"close\". \n\nLink gets his \"typical\" loadout. Master Sword + Hylian Shield (or Mirror Shield, whatever), Boomerang, Bombs, Arrow, Hookshot.\n\nZero gets the Z saber, Z buster, Shield Boomerang, and the Chain Rod. \n\nSince I'm sure some of you aren't as familiar with zero, I'll do a bit of a comparison to the various weapons.\n\nZ Saber vs Master Sword- The Z Saber is a formidable tool, Zero can wield it pretty effortlessly, he can attack many times in rapid succession, he can use it while dashing, while jumping, etc. It's capable of cutting completely through many objects. Unlike the Master Sword, the Z saber requires two hands to wield, but has a longer range. It can be charged up to unleash an elemental attack, be it ice, fire, or electricity. The Master Sword, on the other hand, has shorter range, along with a generally slower attacking speed, but can be used in conjunction with a shield, which makes it a better defensive tool. \n\nZ buster vs Bow and Arrow and Bombs- The Z buster is a pretty standard firearm for the Megaman games, it fires off small balls of energy, but can be charged up to deal more damage, and apply the same elemental effects. It can be fired very quickly, and does not rely on ammo, but it can only fire in 3 round burst. Link's trusty bow and arrow is a pretty standard affair. Link is very skilled with it, and can attach several elements to it, including ice/fire, along with light (which would be pretty pointless against Zero). Link also commonly utilizes Bombs, which can be thrown and shot to explode. These bombs are capable of blowing up rocks and certain weakened walls. \n\nShield Boomerang vs Hylian Shield + Boomerang- Zero's Shield Boomerang is a powerful defensive and offensive tool. It can reflect most projectiles away from him while held in front of him, and it is tall enough to protect most of his body from a standing position. After holding it out for a few seconds, he can toss it like a boomerang, causing it to slice enemies on the way out and back. This attack inflicts elemental damage depending what chip Zero is using. The Hylian Shileld is an indestructible standard \"kite\" shield. There's not much to it, but it is very durable. The Boomerang is one of Link's most reliable weapons, capable of bouncing off of multiple enemies before returning to link. It can also grab items for him, along with hitting switches. \n\nChain Rod vs Hookshot- The Chain Rod is a utility tool that Zero can use for offense, mobility, or grabbing and disarming foes. He can use it to hang onto walls/ceilings, grab items, or even chop foes in half. It's perhaps most useful for pulling down distant objects, such as shields, from enemies. Link's hookshot is generally less versatile, being used mostly for mobility, but it can also be used to grab items, and while it doesn't do much damage, it is capable of stunning foes.\n\nLink vs Zero- Ignoring weapons, Link and Zero are both primarily swordsmen. While they utilizes a variety of tools, both mostly use swords, though Zero uses the more katana-like Z saber, and Link uses the Sword + board combo of the Master Sword + Hylian Shield. Zero is very agile, capable of dashing around with impressive speed, he can also jump on walls, and with the chain rod can swing across certain gaps. Link is less mobile, but more defense oriented, circling around foes and attacking weak points, using the Hylian shield to deflect attacks. \n\nArena- An empty warehouse with no doors.

I see the doctor on here relatively often, but I see a lot of misconceptions regarding him. Figured I'd make a little post about it. \n\n\n1. The doctor has, for the most part, not been wholly opposed to violence. His recent incarnations have been ones to AVOID combat, but the doctor, especially his older incarnations, is entirely capable of combat, and is rather skilled. This is not to say he's going to beat somebody like say, Batman in hand to hand combat, but if he's going against an average human, it's very likely the doctor could defeat them. That being said, the 2 most recent incarnations of the doctor do try to avoid violence unless in a situation of desperation, or extreme anger. Older incarnations, on the other hand, would be a much better match when it comes to just brawling it out. The tardis gives him access to futuristic weaponry (or ancient weaponry, whichever would be needed), and he certainly seems to be able to use pretty much any weapon thrown into his hands. That being said, the doctor is not exceptionally strong or fast. It's somewhat implied that he's at least \"peak human\", but he has no real significant strength or speed feats to note, and as such should probably not be treated as being any stronger than peak human. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmnPs64K74 A great example of the older doctors not only holding, but using weaponry to attack. (Thanks to Xecutioner for the link)\n\n2. The doctor has vast knowledge in multiple areas. He's traveled from the start of time, to the end of time, and many places in between. This only applies to his universe, however. That being said, he's still incredibly proficient at problem solving. He's very hard (but not impossible) to trick, and he's very batman like in his ability to predict a foes moves, and prepare for them accordingly. Trying to outsmart the Doctor is probably not the best way to beat him, but it's also not impossible. His vast knowledge is easily his biggest asset, and it proves to win the day on multiple occasions. The doctor also has defenses against Psychic powers. He's shown resisting Cybermen mind control (Which is, at least, effective on the VAST majority of humans). On top of this, he also regularly uses psychic paper, which shows that his mind is at least somewhat trained to communicate via psychic powers. (HE also, IIRC, communicates memories via touch, which could be more evidence of psychic powers.)\n\n3. The doctor does not tend to carry true weapons. The sonic is a powerful tool, capable of disarming many robots, but it's not impossible to defend against. Other universes that might utilize sonic weaponry will probably have a defense against it, whereas universes where it's not common probably don't. It's shown firing lasers in some parts, but to my knowledge that was just a silly light show more than anything. Psychic paper could be considered another tool of his. It's capable of tricking most people, though it's certainly not going to be useful against psychics, and it's possible to train yourself against it (Which is an important note for fights involving prep time. This being said, he is not opposed to weapons for the most part. He's sort of Macguyver like, in being able to turn many things into tools (Partially thanks to the almost endlessly versatile Sonic Screwdriver.) He's seen upgrading many weapons into more (or less) deadly forms, and creating bombs. And when that isn't an option, he's still very capable of pulling out a gun (Especially his earlier forms.)\n\n4. The TARDIS is pretty op. It's by far the doctor's most powerful \"weapon\", probably surpassing even his intelligence. It's capable of time travel across the vortex, can fly through space, towing the planet earth (Which shows that it's thrust is ridiculously strong, if nothing else.) It has no actual weapons, but it's designed to blend into wherever it lands. It can become invisible, though it rarely needs too (As again, it blends into whatever environment it lands in.) It contains an immeasurable amount of energy, as it's explosion was capable of destroying EVERY universe. (And also, recreating those same universes when they were destroyed by it's explosion in the first place.) The tardis's ability to tank blows has been kinda flip flopped. At times it's capable of surviving pretty much anything, but it has been \"damaged\" before. Most notably, a massive cruise spaceship managed to penetrate it's hull, though it's possible this was due to shields being powered down, or something else. The TARDIS is invaluable when combined with prep time. It gives him a loophole to prep as long as he wants, and he can find an object from anywhere in the universe (or any when.) Let's say that Super Awesome man is 100% invincible, except there's a small stone on a single planet millions of years ago, that he managed to somehow destroy. 99% of people would be unable to touch him, yet the doctor could rather easily (Assuming he figured out the weakness) obtain this rock, and utilize it to secure the win. It's also important to note, that the Doctor without the Tardis is significantly less of a threat. While he's still a genius, the TARDIS gives him access to every time period in whatever universe he happens to be in. It can be utilized in a lot of ways. In situations involving prep time, somebody capable of stealing it would be a pretty big threat to the doctor, as it's a pretty effective way to, if nothing else, distract him. The TARDIS is itself a living entity, and it's not always 100% accurate when traveling (partially due to being \"undermanned\".). That being said, it almost always gets him where he needs to go. \n\n5. While regenerating, the doctor gains some interesting power. He's capable of effortlessly regenerating limbs, and it's shown that his regeneration energy can actually be harmful to others. Another interesting note, though possibly not an actual abillity of the doctor, when River Song (Who was also a time lord) regenerated, she was capable of killing others (either through the regeneration energy, or by reflecting the bullets back, it's not entirely clear). Assuming the doctor gains similar resilience, this would mean that, while the doctor is regenerating, he's capable of taking more damage than normal. Upon regenerating, the doctor takes a completely different form. The doctor is USUALLY vulnerable while regenerating, but he has shown to be able to function normally directly after a regeneration, so it may depend on how much damage he sustained. In the new series, he's shown after absorbing the time vortex, that he is unable to stay awake for more than seconds at a time, yet when he regenerates into his 11th form, he's merely hungry. \n\n6. The doctor is far from immortal. While he's capable of regeneration, he's still vulnerable while doing it. If both of his hearts stop (though stopping one seems to have little effect.), he dies, and if killed while regenerating, he dies. It's unknown how much force is actually needed to kill the doctor while regenerating, but it's not unreasonable to say it would take a good bit. Simple punches/bullets probably won't do it. The Doctor originally had a limit to his regenerations, but he recently was given the opportunity to ignore that limitation, so he now has 13 more regenerations to use. If you are going to try to kill him over and over again, you'll need to do it 12 more times. \n\n7. The doctor does machines. He has an uncanny knack for knowing how pretty much every machine works, and is capable of picking out any weak points almost immediately. Combining that with his abillity to talk about pretty much anything to distract someone, the two combined make for some pretty interesting situations. He's very good at slowly working his way toward an important part of a machine, and then using that part as a bargaining chip.\n\n7. The doctor loves a good bargain. While I said earlier the doctor (depending on regeneration) isn't wholly opposed to violence, his recent incarnations are very good at bargaining. He seems to have a knack for finding something the other side needs, and then using that chip as a means to negotiate. He's even shown bluffing on a few occasions. Giving him prep time, it's entirely possible that, instead of trying to fight straight on, that (especially a newer incarnation) will find something that you desperately need, and use that to win the day. \n\n8. The doctor is almost godlike in his prep time. He's very intelligent, and has practically infinite time thanks to his TARDIS. These two mean that the doctor is very hard to defeat if he knows what he's going against. It's not impossible to throw some red herrings in to trick him, but he's capable of orchestrating some rather impressive feats when given any sort of prep time. In a moments notice he can devise a plan, and then watch it come to fruition, even while captured. \n\n\nSo what does this all mean? The doctor is not really a superhero. He's not going to win many straight up fights. Much like Batman, he requires prep time to win an actual 1v1 fight. If the foe has no real weaknesses, he's probably going to lose. \n\nThe proper time to use the doctor in a fight, is usually in a \"can the doctor do (BLANK). Can he save somebody from another villain, can he stop (Blank) attack on (Blank) planet. Straight up fights with the doctor are going to almost always boil down to\n\n1. Does he have prep time?\n2. Do they have an exploitable weakness?\n\nIf the answer to those is yes, he's going to win pretty much 100% of the time. If they have no exploitable weaknesses, the Doctor can still utilize some pretty impressive weapons to take them out (along with the whole \"go back in time, kill you while you are weak\" thing.) Without prep time and the TARDIS, the Doctor only really stands a chance against beings vulnerable to the sonic screwdriver, or those he can outsmart.
