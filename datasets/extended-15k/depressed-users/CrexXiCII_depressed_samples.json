(I still sometimes do)\n\n\nI was so depressed that I would feel nothing at all and I wouldn\u2019t care if I die or whatever...\n\n\nI was disappointed by this world \nDisappointed by the medical system that didn\u2019t seem to help \nDisappointed of my church and the people in it \nDisappointed of my parents \nDisappointed of my friends .. \n\nI lost them all \n\nFor me the only thing that was left was god!\n\nLike I said before I believed in god \nAnd that was the only thing I was holding onto, the only thing I was able to say that I don\u2019t know who god is and every time I read the Bible(like we christians do) I was told about a god that cared about people(psalm 139) a god that heals, Jesus walked on earth healing people ! \n\nThe god in the bible really cared about people and didn\u2019t leave them dying....\n\n\nThat was everything I could think of and of course I doubted god and the church and everything I was so confused about myself and my life. I also realised that what i was believing in was totally nothing more but a religion if it wasn\u2019t true what the bible said and if god wasn\u2019t real ! \n\nI never wanted a fake life a fake religion, that\u2019s weird ! \n\nAnyway, I decided to go after this fucking question.. \n\nGod are you real, when yes I want to know ! \nI don\u2019t want to hear it anymore, I don\u2019t want to read it anymore I want to freaking experience what you are talking about !\n\n\nFrom here on my life turned around and I decided to go away from everything by myself, somehow a door got opened and I was already on my way to another country where I seeked for god if he\u2019s real or not ! \n\n\nGod is real \n\nI experienced him in a way I could have never imagined... \n\nI had visions of him sitting at my bed all night long in the days that I was suffering ! \n\nI realised that what I knew about him was influenced by my culture and other people around me so I assumed them to be true! \n\nI realised that I knew nothing about what it means to know god and eventually to know what I was born for or what my purpose was.\n\n\n\nThis is not everything, I don\u2019t remember the last 5 years very much because I was in a trauma or something so I get flashback all the times that really make my everyday a mess.. \n\nIt\u2019s so painful to think about my past and everything that has happened it still stresses me out so much! \n\n\nI hate religion and I am in a process of getting to know god personally one to one. \n\n\nI hope somebody is encouraged !\n\nShout out to god he will hear you and bring healing into your life, seek him!\n\nHe\u2019s the only reason I am still alive!\n\nGod doesn\u2019t owe us!\n\n\nMuch love !\n\n\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 392984, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hey, I want to share something with you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ln9qo/hey_i_want_to_share_something_with_you/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "CrexXiCII", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2b9iek2p", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538639981, "domain": "self.NoFapChristians", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/9l9wa2/day_4/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9l9wa2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/NoFapChristians/comments/9l9wa2/day_4/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1538639981, "score": 1, "selftext": "I almost relapsed, it was rough today ! \nHere is what I learned today:\n\nDon\u2019t let fear rule your life but conviction.\n\n\nStop telling yourself, how afraid you are of relapsing but tell yourself all the things you\u2019re convinced about Christ! \n\nSomething else I found helpful is taking off tension of myself! \n\nI tell myself that it\u2019s okey to watch porn, rather than being so afraid of doing it it allows me to think clearly and make an active decision to not watch it for I am convinced about it ! \n\n\nHope you understand what I mean ! \n\nThanks everyone for encouraging me !
