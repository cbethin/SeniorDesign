We connected over health struggles, she had epilepsy and a muscle disorder that she needed leg braces. After a few months we were together, but a few months after that she got sick, a misdiagnosis and botched surgery snowballed into a chronic state of illness, she was only 20. Despite that I stayed, I knew what it was like be told \u201cI can\u2019t handle that you\u2019re sick\u201d and I would never hurt her like that. Life proceeded, With her encouragement I started going back to college, in reality I was doing it for our future together, I wasn\u2019t worth doing something like that for myself.\n\nMy second semester in college she ended up with pneumonia bad enough her oxygen levels dropped and she slipped into a coma. She\u2019s a fighter and made it through, but forgot our entire relationship, she remembered who I was and how she felt, just nothing else, she broke up with me, that was too much for her. After a month we did get back together, she decided we needed to start over, and we did.\n\nAnd here I am, just an internship to finish to get the associates degree I\u2019m working for, and some dipshit resident decides her life isn\u2019t worth living and lets an infection progress to the point that even if she fights it off, she\u2019d die from organ damage in the following months, never informing her or her family or even considering treating her... she was 23, and she wanted it live. she passed away 5 weeks ago, and I don\u2019t know how to continue with life, I\u2019m lost, my future shattered, and I have no clue how to even start picking up the pieces.

She passed away Tuesday night. This is just truly hitting me this morning. It feels like a dream, just an awful fucking dream...\n\nI found out what was happening, though I don\u2019t know the full details, it wasn\u2019t her sister who was manipulating her, it was her mom, I still don\u2019t know why, the only reasons I can think of for her doing this is to cause drama to gossip about, and/or to have control over her, not wanting her to rely on anyone else at all. \n\nMy girlfriend\u2019s step sister had talked her into letting me come see her, she seemed glad to see me and I thought the visit went well. I was told I could only stay about an hour, I didn\u2019t want to cause more drama so I didn\u2019t resist that at all. While I was there my girlfriend wanted to look through the pictures on my phone with me, I didn\u2019t see any way that could cause a problem so we were looking through the pictures until we came up to the 4 photos I had of her and her sisters laying together on the bed, I had come to see her sisters as if they are family, I wanted a picture of them together, but my girlfriend\u2019s eyes kept being closed so I took another and then another until one worked. They all knew I was taking the pictures. When she came to those she asked me why I had them, not remembering, I said because I wanted a picture of her with her sisters and she didn\u2019t say anything else. Apparently she had seen something that wasn\u2019t there, she was on heavy painkillers and that is understandable, but she didn\u2019t tell me that she thought it was bad. She told her mom as I was leaving and she comes storming out of the house and accusing me of having inappropriate pictures of her daughters (my girlfriend\u2019s sisters) and I instantly show her the pictures and she looks at them and says to delete a specific one because it was upsetting to my girlfriend, even though it wasn\u2019t actually inappropriate, she agrees my girlfriend is just overreacting because of the meds. \n\nWhat happens next I only heard from her step sister because no one else will talk to me about it, but her step sister was furious at me. According to her my girlfriend\u2019s mom came in saying I have 5 inappropriate pictures of her sisters, saying one zoomed in on one sister\u2019s chest and one zoomed in on the younger sister\u2019s butt, both of which were lies, my girlfriend was so upset she was puking the whole night. I never hear from my girlfriend again. I recovered the photo to show her step sister, I then showed her the other 3, but because my girlfriend\u2019s mom said I had 5 pictures, it looks like I\u2019m hiding something. \n\nWhen the obituary got posted to Facebook everyone who you\u2019d expect to be tagged in the post was, except me, both of her other sister\u2019s boyfriends were tagged, even though one she had only met once, and the other she can\u2019t stand. I know that\u2019s overall unimportant, it was just extremely insulting.\n\nWhat hurts the most isn\u2019t what pain was caused to me, but what pain was caused to my girlfriend because of these lies. How could a mother do that to her dying mother? Even if I was doing something shady, shouldn\u2019t she have lied? Instead of feeding this soap opera bullshit? To save her feelings in her final days? It makes me sick, I\u2019ve decided I won\u2019t have anything to do with any of them after the funeral. \n\nI decided not to confront her mom while my girlfriend was alive because even if I could get her to believe the truth, it would hurt her even more than the lies, and my love for her is stronger than my pride", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 819181, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(Update) My (28M) girlfriend (23F) of almost three years is on her deathbed and refuses to let me see her, or even respond to texts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9jecsx/update_my_28m_girlfriend_23f_of_almost_three/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Weaslenut", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_idm6hwf", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537539179, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hqamr/my_28m_girlfriend_23f_of_almost_3_years_is_on_her/", "id": "9hqamr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 87, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hqamr/my_28m_girlfriend_23f_of_almost_3_years_is_on_her/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537539180, "score": 1, "selftext": "It isn\u2019t in the \u201cit\u2019s too painful to see you\u201d kind of way either, which I would respect fully, she\u2019s angry at me about something, and I have no idea what.

From talking to her mom it seems like something isn\u2019t being said, when I asked about that she just got angry at me, from talking to her step sister I found out she\u2019s upset about something but won\u2019t say what. My only guess is that one of her sisters (20f) is up to no good manufacturing drama, because that\u2019s what she\u2019s always done. That sister had walked up on me talking on the phone to a friend that is like a sister to me, that I\u2019ve known since childhood and my girlfriend knows about, this friend was even the first to donate to my girlfriend\u2019s go fund me page, but when her sister walked up she made a comment about \u201ctalking to other girls already\u201d which at the time I blew off but I just have a feeling she told my girlfriend in a way that made it sound like I was cheating. This might not be what\u2019s happening, but either way there isn\u2019t time for this.\n\nI get that it\u2019s my girlfriend\u2019s last days and that what she wants is going to go, but she went from wanting me there as much as possible to not even responding to texts tells me something is up, and she is in an emotional state that can be easily manipulated, and it breaks my heart to think she\u2019ll pass angry with me, and knowing her, it breaks her heart to think that too. \n\nTl:dr; My girlfriend is dying and won\u2019t let me see her or text me back, and is angry at me about something, I can only assume it\u2019s because her sister is manipulating her.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 804718, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (28m) girlfriend (23f) of almost 3 years is on her deathbed and refuses to let me see her, or even respond to texts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hqamr/my_28m_girlfriend_23f_of_almost_3_years_is_on_her/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Weaslenut", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_idm6hwf", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537317718, "domain": "self.findareddit", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/9h0htv/is_there_a_subreddit_to_help_find_scholarly/", "id": "9h0htv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "unansweredflair", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Unanswered", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/findareddit/comments/9h0htv/is_there_a_subreddit_to_help_find_scholarly/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537317719, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "findareddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sey6", "subreddit_subscribers": 171038, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is there a subreddit to help find scholarly articles or research on a specific subject?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/9h0htv/is_there_a_subreddit_to_help_find_scholarly/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Weaslenut", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_idm6hwf", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537295086, "domain": "self.Advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9gxdq8/i_bought_a_promise_ring_for_my_terminally_ill/", "id": "9gxdq8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "relationships", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7ab2cb02-6631-11e4-b11d-12313d0522c4", "link_flair_text": "Serious", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 41, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Advice/comments/9gxdq8/i_bought_a_promise_ring_for_my_terminally_ill/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537295087, "score": 1, "selftext": "There\u2019s no knowing how much longer my girlfriend has left, I had been putting off buying a ring and proposing for months.

I\u2019ve known for two years this day would come, but after everything she had beat made me believe it was much further out. She\u2019s only 23, she doesn\u2019t deserve this, she didn\u2019t deserve any of it, and all because some egotistical doctor thought they knew what was best.\n\nSince the first surgery two and a half years ago she has had countless more, she has spent as much time in hospitals as she has out, she has been in two comas, once from pneumonia and the other I can\u2019t remember, she is in so much pain, all the time... there have been 5 times that I can remember being told she\u2019s not going to make it, I stopped believing it, I thought she\u2019d always pull through, the doctor had even said last Wednesday that she only had 24 hours, she proved him wrong too, but there\u2019s something different happening. Hospice has gotten involved, as I type this they are stopping her TPN (IV nutrition), after that she has 1-9 days. They are doing this because she has an infection that has been growing in the background unseen for some time, and the TPN is just feeding it, it has damaged her pancreas, gallbladder, liver and something else beyond what can heal, her lungs and heart are also damaged from the last coma that was in April. \n\nThis is hard to accept, she seems normal, only slightly jaundiced, but her mind is still there, other times she was out of it whenever she\u2019d get really sick. Part of me is still holding onto hope that she can get through it, she has actually gone 14 days without the TPN before when she had sepsis and the hospital wouldn\u2019t give it to her. But she\u2019s ready, she hasn\u2019t told me yet, but she says she\u2019s tired, she\u2019s fought enough. Her mom telling me that hurt, two weeks ago she told me not to be scared, because her story isn\u2019t over, but now it\u2019s coming to a close. I don\u2019t blame her, I get it, I just don\u2019t want it to be like this. \n\nThis is the first day since I found out that I haven\u2019t been with her, her mom asked me to leave so that she and her sisters can have a day or two without visitors, which she has been getting a lot of, and it\u2019s overwhelming her, I barely got any time alone with her this weekend unfortunately, but this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about her.

The biggest problem is she thinks she tells me things that she doesn\u2019t, and she gets angry at me for \u201cforgetting\u201d things she never told me, the majority of our communication is through text, so it is very easy to go back and see what was said, when I say she never told me, and that she can see that she never told me, she accuses me of lying, even though she can look back and see that I\u2019m not, I never say it rude or confrontationally, I do my best to stay respectful and calm, but she gets upset no matter what, I have tried lying and just letting her think I forgot, but she gets just as angry, so I have decided to just always say the truth. \n\nShe has been giving me the silent treatment for the last few days, I learned this morning it was because I spent the weekend with my brother instead of her, but she never told me that she wanted me to come over, and she stopped talking after I told her I was going to my brother\u2019s to work on his house. I only know that is why she is mad because I talked to her mom, who thought I just blew her off to do things with my brother. \n\nLast week she said she didn\u2019t want to lose me, because there was another set back in her overall health, but I would never leave her because of her health, but unless she starts actually discussing problems instead of just shutting me out I don\u2019t know if I can take it, it\u2019s having a serious effect on my mood, and sends my anxiety through the roof. I start an internship tomorrow and if I don\u2019t get this worked out with her it is going to be obvious something is wrong and detrimental to my ability to work. (I can do it, It is just clear that my mind is somewhere else).

that you\u2019re sick and it takes a toll, I get that you hurt constantly and the pain meds aren\u2019t working anymore, I\u2019m not asking for much, we don\u2019t see each other anymore since you\u2019ve been getting worse, and I barely hear from you, it doesn\u2019t feel like we are in a relationship anymore, I feel like I\u2019m just that annoying friend that you respond to out of pity instead of your boyfriend. You\u2019ve been through more than anyone should have to, two and a half years of hell, dozens of hospital stays, countless surgeries, countless med changes as they figure out what helps. But you seem to forget I\u2019ve been through it with you too, it\u2019s not nearly as hard on me, but going through everything with you has been the hardest thing I\u2019ve experienced, especially when you were on life support, did you know when the doctor said you probably didn\u2019t have 48 hours I stayed awake for three days in that ICU waiting room, or your room when they would allow it? Surviving on sprite and hospital cafeteria sushi? I know it was harder on you than I can imagine, but it was harder on me than you realize, I had to watch the woman I plan on spending my life with suffer in unimaginable ways, doctors saying there is no hope and advising giving up, but we didn\u2019t, and you proved the doctors wrong again, just like you always do. \n\nBut now I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, I see on Facebook that you got admitted again last night, but no one bothered to tell me, all I want is to know you\u2019re okay and that it\u2019s not leading to sepsis again, but I guess that\u2019s too much to ask. Do you want me to come see you? We haven\u2019t seen each other since May, we haven\u2019t had a real conversation since May. I just miss you beyond belief, but it doesn\u2019t seem like you even care. Our relationship is the only thing in your life you have control of right now, maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re pushing me away, to have that little bit of power over your life, but it\u2019s not worth it, I can\u2019t live like this forever. And when I finally do reach the end, it won\u2019t be because you\u2019re sick, you\u2019ve been afraid that I\u2019d leave you for that since that first botched surgery, I don\u2019t care about the scars or the tubes or that we can\u2019t do the things we want to, it will be because you can\u2019t respect my feelings, actually you being as sick as you are is probably the biggest reason I\u2019ve put up with it. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re pushing me away again because you\u2019re scared I\u2019m going to leave? Haven\u2019t I proven that I\u2019m not going to? I\u2019ve stayed loyal through three breaks even, if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s a fear that fulfills itself.\n\nThe only reason I haven\u2019t proposed is because of how you do this, I don\u2019t want to have to beg for the slightest amount of affection, I don\u2019t want attention constantly, I just want you to acknowledge that I exist at least once a day. You say you hurt too bad, but you\u2019re on Facebook posting and commenting, is it petty of me to think that if you are able to do that you can at least tell me good morning or goodnight instead of going days in between texts? \n\nYour sister told me that you absolutely adore me, and at times you act like a teenager again when you know I\u2019m coming over. But that\u2019s not who I see, when I get there you are cold and distant most of the time, showing just barely enough of that side of you for me to believe you when you say you love me. \n\nBut I\u2019ve said all this to you before, and you just don\u2019t get it, or you just don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll always love you, but I don\u2019t know how much more I can take.

Up until this coma (it was pneumonia that got really bad) she had always still been the person I fell in love with, the countless surgeries and ER visits never changed her, this time she did.\n\nI expected it to take a while for her to get back to who she was, but I don\u2019t know if I can wait for that, or if it will even come. She\u2019s angry at the world and is taking it out on everyone who cares about her, she\u2019s pushing me away but then starts crying because in her head she thinks I\u2019m pushing her away, but I\u2019m doing everything I can to try to be there for her... at this point I don\u2019t know what to do, almost anything I say she turns into an argument, everything I don\u2019t say turns into an argument, she shows no signs of affection, if I pick up my phone around her she gets paranoid that I\u2019m cheating on her and texting them (I\u2019m not cheating). And if I ever bring up anything that I\u2019m having issues with she becomes extremely dismissive and completely ignores me. I get no support, or love, I don\u2019t know if I can last much longer.

their own problems and I don\u2019t want to burden them.\n\nPlease don\u2019t just say I need to leave her, that\u2019s not something I need to hear, I hear it from everyone around me. \n\nTL:DR My

On Monday she finally saw the specialist and he discovered what was causing the pain, stomach contractions, her stomach is starting to work for the first time in Two years!! They have since replaced the G-tube with a Mickey button, and the doctor says with time she may even be able to eat soft foods again. \n\nNone of this is exactly secret, but I am hesitant to become too excited just in case things don\u2019t work out or somehow go bad.

though she has left me 3 times, so we have only been back together for 5 months, she first got sick 4 months into our relationship, it is too difficult to explain what is wrong, it\u2019s not cancer or anything that has a name, it\u2019s more of her body started failing after a botched surgery, and she is considered terminal. She has been unable to eat since she got sick, she is on TPN, and probably will be on it the rest of her life. I am a cancer survivor, and I know how devastating it is when someone else can\u2019t handle that you\u2019re sick, and I am worried that if I leave her she will stop fighting, and lose her will to live. Her mom takes care of her, there is a lot that needs to be done and I am learning a lot of it. \n\nLately she has been hinting, rather overtly, that I should get her an engagement ring for Christmas, and move in, which is unrealistic because I don\u2019t drive (severe anxiety, I can control it with everything except driving) and I\u2019m still in college and she lives 50 minutes away from my college, which is a lot if I am to be driven there. But the more she pressures me to get engaged and move in the more I realize I don\u2019t think I can handle it long term, and I don\u2019t think I want to anymore. I don\u2019t know how to tell her these feelings without devastating her. \n\nOther things that will get in the way are that I am passive and she is stubborn, which was fine before, but now there are things she cannot do, and the temptation to eat things is getting too strong, and she will not listen when I tell her not to do do something. She doesn\u2019t realize I hate to tell her she can\u2019t do something, but when I do, it is for her, not because I want to control her. \n\nShe is also getting jealous, in my program at college I am the only guy, there are 6 of us who have been in almost all the same classes together for the last year and a half (it\u2019s just an associate\u2019s degree so we just have one more semester), and if I am texting with a classmate she gets almost accusatory, she realizes it and apologizes but it seems like her mind is going too, it isn\u2019t the pain meds because it has only been going on the last 2 months. We have been fighting a lot, and almost every time it starts because she misunderstands and something and either breaks into tears or she gets angry, she is doing this with everyone, her doctors, parents, siblings and me. \n\nA month ago her mom pulled me aside and told me I am all she has, seeing me is all she looks forward to. Her friends have given up and most don\u2019t care anymore, they never come see her. I was going to break up with her that day her mom said that to me, but that stopped me.\n\nI feel like I have just been holding onto the fantasy of what could have been, and I am finally realizing how unrealistic it all is. We\u2019ll never be able to live alone, an no matter how bad she wants it, we\u2019ll never be able to have kids, she is too sick to handle getting pregnant and we\u2019d never be able to adopt because of her health, we also can\u2019t get married, because it will effect her government benefits. It feels like she just wants to get married and everything because she is facing her own mortality and wants to have that experience before she dies, and there is no way to tell how long that will be, or even that it\u2019s a certainty, because it is possible she can recover to a decent level, it is just very unlikely.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, I don\u2019t know what I want, the only thing I still know is I love her, but I don\u2019t know if that will be enough. What should I do? Is it wrong to leave a dying woman? Is it wrong to stay in an unhappy relationship because your partner is sick?\n\ntl;dr My girlfriend is seriously sick, I am unhappy, I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m afraid she will lose her will to fight if I leave her. I do love her though.
