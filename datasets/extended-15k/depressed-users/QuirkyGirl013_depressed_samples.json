I am a 29 year old female, single child, that has not been living at home for the past 10 years (I live in another country). \nA couple of months ago I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety, panic attacks and OCD. Since then I have been going regularly to a psychiatrist and psychotherapist. They made me do a bunch of tests. I found out I am an INTJ personality type, and that I have mommy AND daddy issues.\nI've known about the daddy issues ans I have been battling them for 15 years. But the mommy issue came as a huge surprise! I thought I had an amazing relationship with my mom. But when i told my \"psycho doctors\" that my mother calls me her project, and that she spent 29 years on it and that it must not fail. All of them looked at me like I  turned green and grew 10 ft tall! They were shocked. I thought that that was a totally normal and ordinary statement. What do you think, is it? When I visit home she acts as if I am 14 again. She has been telling me that I will never grow up, that my opinions are childish, or that my though process has disappointed her. If I don't agree with her she somehow makes me guilty, even though I did nothing wrong! I am almost 30, and I am not allowed to sleep over anywhere , nor is anyone allowed to sleep at my place. She has been telling me for the last God knows how long, that she sacrificed everything for me, and all that she has done was for me... And then i feel guilty, and don't say what I really want or feel.\nYesterday I guy harassed me at the gym, and I had I huge panic attack (it's not the first time I've been harassed in the last 10 years, I've also been stalked), and I am all alone here,everybody that I care about and who care about me are back home. I talked to my father about moving back home for a while, to get my head straight. He said no problem, anything I need. But she got mad and disappointed. I'm in a long distance relationship with a guy back home. She got mad because she thinks I'm giving up my life to be closer to him. Before this relationship I was single for 3 years, and she kept asking me almost everyday if I have met someone. I just don't understand. She doesn't want to accept that I have depression, or anxiety, or panic attacks. She keeps telling me to grow out of it, and that all people have problems.\nI seriously thought that that is how a mother-daughter relationship should look like. And that her behavior towards me was really good. I thought I turned out fine, except my emotionally damaged part. But am I overreacting? Am I looking too deep into it? Is it all in my head? Please just help me understand, my life is a mess right now. Thank you for your help.
