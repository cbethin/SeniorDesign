One told me if I feel bad or need help that hell be there for me.\n\nThe other 3 are not this understanding. 2 of them are saying \"it cant come out of nowhere, you need to have some traumatic experiences\" or \"you cant feel sad when theres no reason for it, something needs to happen\" or the famous \"other people are worse off then you\". The last of them four is taking it very seriously and also believes me, he saw that I spiraled down in the last years. But he also doesnt understand it. Today he tried to motivate me into going to a club, meeting new girls or just having some fun there. I told him no, I dont feel like it. He said \"how do you want to overcome your listlessness if you never do anything?\". Its not like I dont want to go bc Im unmotivated, but I fear too much social interaction, especially crowded places and talking to strangers.   \n\n\nSo, how would you try to explain a non-depressed person how it feels like having depression, especially the main symptoms?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 406701, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you explain to someone who never suffered from depression how it feels?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9y1dd8/how_do_you_explain_to_someone_who_never_suffered/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "BGNuke", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14mi50", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541682223, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9v9srp/my_friends_2126_and_me_20_want_to_get_rid_of_a/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9v9srp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/9v9srp/my_friends_2126_and_me_20_want_to_get_rid_of_a/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1541682223, "score": 1, "selftext": "This story involves multiple people and i hope it doesnt get to confusing.\n\nIt all started when a friend of us (lets call him Jake) introduced us to a friend of his (we call him Paul). He told us beforehand that hes a bit different but a good guy at all. Boy he was never that wrong. He started to hang up with us more and more and became a friend of us all too. So we invited him to our vacation to croatia (that was septembre 2017).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all knew that hes not the smartest and cant help himself with many things, but in croatia we firstly saw how bad it actually was. We were in Jakes grandmas house and because we are friends of Jake we paid no rent (we all gave her 100\u20ac each nonetheless). We had a boiler in our room and Jake told us to not use it because it was broken or something like this. Paul still used it everytime, and not knowing how a boiler works he put it on and immediatly went to take a shower etc. He didnt even turned the thing off. It was one of the biggest myths why he always turned it on, because even after like 1 hour of it being on we still had no warm water. But we let it slide, no biggie, but pretty annoying when Jake told Paul every 3 hours to leave the thing off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis ineptitude showed one more time because we all wanted to go to the beach, him including. We needed to tell him every step on how to change clothes, because if we didnt he would just sit on the bed and listen to some music, forget his towel and so on. The one friend who was also with us (Adis) was pissed af because we had to deal with it every day and he is somewhat short tempered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe went to Zadar where we met 2 guys at a hooka bar and they walked with us out because they were looking for a party aswell. As we were in the club me and one of them both were going to 2 girls and started talking with them. Not even 2 minutes in Paul started to scream out for me from the other side that he wanted to show me something. The girl was very confused on whats going on. He wouldnt stop calling me so I said that Im going to look for him. I introduced her to Adis and went off. He wanted to show me some boring fb vids. I was pissed af.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome days later he started to tell us individually that he things that the other one hates him. To me he said \"I think Adis hates me\", to Jake he said that he thinks I would hate him and to Adis he said he thinks Jake hates him. We all were pissed but it wasnt hate, and thats what I said to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same night we talked about some traffic incidents that happened to us (because another friend was involved in a car accident). He told us that he once run over 3 guys. We all looked to one another and then Adis asked him \"Why would you do that?\". His answer was that he didnt liked the way they looked at him. We were all somewhat drunk and thought he was just talking shit and so started giggling like idiots. I also didnt believed him because if so he would have been caught. But then I thought more and more about it and I asked Adis what if the 3 people are we, because we made some jokes about him and that he may be pissed and just has threatened us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow fast forward we kinda forgave him. He went with Jake and Adis, another friend (Kervan) and Adis brother (Caleb) to turkey. The organisation was horrible. Adis gave everyone a deadline until everyone has to pay, because he already booked it, and cancelling would cost like 400\u20ac. Everyone said that he should book, they will give him the money in time (700-800\u20ac) and they did. Besides Paul. Adis even went to the bank with him where Paul threw in the bank transfer. It turned out he didnt had any money on his bank account and just wanted to waste time till he gets paid. He didnt told us tho, and he wouldve gotten the money after the deadline. So his father transferred the money (Adis found out because in the bank transfer there was the name of Pauls father, not Paul). So he lied and tried to manipulate us and even risk the vacation everyone has already paid for because of reasons I cant unterstand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n They told me about some shit that went down. He beat Jake while being drunk. They BOTH got a warning from the security, even tho Jake did nothing, he didnt defend himself, because he was too fast on the ground.\n\nAs I heard it in the same night from Adis I was scared for their safety.\n\nThe next day Paul said hes sorry for what happened. Jake didnt answered and just went off. Paul said \"Today Im going to get drunk again\". When I heard this I thought how sorry can he be if he wants to do it right again?\n\n2 days later Jake and Adis met 2 girls. Jake is in a relationship and just entertained her friend while Adis talked to the other. It clicked between Adis and this girl and Paul was jealous, even though he has a girlfriend (he has a history with cheating on his gfs). In that night Paul beat a guy from Fulda and Caleb at a pool party. He also threw a road sign at Adis leaving him with 2 scars. He ran around the pool shouting \"I need alcohol!\" (the bar keeper didnt served him alcohol after some drinks). The music turned off and 2-3 security man hold thight to him. Everyone in the group messaged me with the things that are happening and we came to the conclusion to throw him out.\n\nThat was before the next day. Paul met the girl whos chilling with Adis alone and he was boozed already. She had a hatred on him because she witnessed everything that was going on. But nonetheless he wanted to kiss her, the girl of another friend, while being in a relationship. Luckily she was able to defend herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in Germany he told us how sorry he was and wanted to make it up to us by inviting us to a restaurant. Lets say it this way: 2 months later and we still didnt went. It wouldnt even change our opinion. He told us we are his only friends, so Adis invited him to his bday because he thought it would be an asshole move to not do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdis talked to Paul when he randomly met him at the gym and Paul confessed that he sees the things with girls as a competition, what would explain why he tried so hard to mess up every contact everyone has with girls.\n\nHe also suffers from very low self esteem (nothing we didnt thought about already) and thinks that he doesnt fit in because we all go to college while he only has main school readiness. We told him that we dont care about that, we care about him being a gentle guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheres sooo much more I could tell,  but I guess thats more then enough.\n\nSo we all want to talk to him tomorrow bc we think thats the only fair thing to do, but still get away from him. We are not sure on how to handle with the situation because he is so unpredictable and everything could happen. We are somewhat scared that he shows up in our houses or stalking us, maybe bringing a knife with him tomorrow. Wouldnt wonder if Id post in r/legaladvice after the confrontation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm very grateful for every recommendations on how to get rid of a potentially dangerous person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** We want to get rid of a friend with a background of violence, cheating, and actually maybe being a sociopath and dont know how", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_subscribers": 923561, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My friends (21-26) and me (20) want to get rid of a potentially dangerous \"friend\" (23)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9v9srp/my_friends_2126_and_me_20_want_to_get_rid_of_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "BGNuke", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14mi50", "can_mod_post": false, "content_categories": ["gaming"], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538698258, "domain": "self.Overwatch", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/9lhdxl/keep_getting_matched_with_very_good_players/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9lhdxl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "a", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Highlight"}], "link_flair_text": "Highlight", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Overwatch/comments/9lhdxl/keep_getting_matched_with_very_good_players/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538698260, "score": 1, "selftext": "Im pretty new to this game (level 9 with I guess 3h playtime) and I keep getting matched up against some level 80+ that are wayyy out of my league.   \nIts getting really frustrating to try and climb to level 25 for comp games.  \nI just wanted to ask why do I keep getting matched up with this superior players and will the matchmaking be better in comp in a matter of evenness?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Overwatch", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl", "subreddit_subscribers": 1500577, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Keep getting matched with very good players", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/9lhdxl/keep_getting_matched_with_very_good_players/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "BGNuke", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14mi50", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537293249, "domain": "self.pokemongo", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/9gx41c/curveball_problems_with_the_galaxy_s9/", "id": "9gx41c", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/pokemongo/comments/9gx41c/curveball_problems_with_the_galaxy_s9/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537293250, "score": 1, "selftext": "Helo everyone,\n\nI just wanted to ask quickly if someone else has problems with the Samsung Galaxy S9+.\n\nEverytime I try to do a curveball with my thumbs the ball slips awayto the under right corner or when I try to throw it goes straight to the left corner on the top, with no curve whatsoever.\n\nI got this phone last saturday, with the S5 I dont have any problems.\n\nBtw: if I do a curveball with the thumb the berry option and ball option show up for not even a second before disappearing again.

Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**\n\n\\*In like 2-3 months, maybe earlier\n\n&gt;\\*\\*What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard\n\nI need the cpu, gpu, coolers, mobo, ram, power supply and a case (Im going with the S340 Elite in dark blue)\n\n&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**\n\n* Germany\n\n&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**\n\n* Ill reuse my HannspreeHL247DBB (going to upgrade afterwards, recommendations are greatly appreciated)  \nLogitech M185 mouse (going to upgrade on a Roccat Kone Aimo as I tested it in our local hardware shop and it fits my hand perfectly)   \nLogitech K270 keyboard (going to change it later too, idk with what tho)  \nSanDisk SSD Plus 120GB\n\n&gt;**Will you be overclocking?

(ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**\n\n* Im going for a black blue color scheme. So the S340 Elite in black blue is a must have.  \nOtherwise Id like to go with a AMD Ryzen 7 2700X and I guess a 1070TI.  \nAlso 4 Ram slots would be nice for future RAM extensions.\n\n&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**\n\n* NZXT S340 Elite in black blue.
