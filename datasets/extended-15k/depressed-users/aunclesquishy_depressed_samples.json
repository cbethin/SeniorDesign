My mental disabilities (executive dysfunction, ADHD, depression, OCD, anxiety, and nonverbal learning disability) make it difficult for me to handle things. When we first started dating I was at a low point personally and in my relationship with my family. Because of this he has a mostly negative view of them, and tbh some of it is justified, but we're all working hard rebuild bridges, and it's actually working. I also have difficulty showing emotion and using proper body language, as well as reading others' emotions and body language.\n\nThe big issues that come up in our relationship re: my mental health are that I need a lot of... reassuring? attention? He's my rock; he brings me back to earth when I'm panicking, cheers me up when i feel down for no reason, and walks me through situations I don't understand or feel confused/stuck on.\n\nI'm sensitive and hard to read and sometimes hard to reach. I've told by people that I make car rides uncomfortable because I don't start/maintain conversation, but that's only because I have nothing to say. Or if I do have something to say, I don't use many words to do so. My fianc\u00e9 understands this so I'm pretty sure it's fine, but who doesn't want a nice conversation now and then? Even I do but I don't know how to start/keep one if I have nothing interesting to say. I don't many interesting things and my interests/tastes in music are usually very different from people I know (his included), so I think I just bore or confuse people by talking about them. And anyway how can you go when some days the most interesting thing you did is make your bed for once?\n\nHe's extremely supportive of things I care about that others aren't (like my dreams of a career in animation) and we've been engaged for about three months, so rationally I know that--while I'm sure some days are harder than others--he's with me because he genuinely wants to be.\n\nBut I'm not good at doing the same thing for him. Partly because he doesn't open up even when I ask, partly because I don't push enough to see if something's wrong. Twice now there have been times where he needed me, and I--not realizing he wanted me with him--thought I should give him space so I did. Or if I do stay with I don't know what to do besides a hug and an 'it'll be okay.' And I just feel like a selfish idiot for not knowing the most basic thing about comforting someone. We've been together for almost five years and he knows exactly what I need and can tell when I have a problem I haven't shared, so I should be able to help! \n\nHe's going through some heavy stuff that he doesn't rly talk about and even when he first told me I just kind of took him at face value and didn't think 'hey maybe he's hiding something.' He called me out on it this past Friday--which I'm glad he did it, and I'm working to improve though I don't rly know how or where to start--and I apologized and promised to be more attentive, and I'm trying but he still seems fine, so idk if he IS fine for now or...?\n\nAnyway then I started crying and explained how because of xyz I didn't try harder to help with his issues. I feel like no matter what happens I bring everything to how things affect me, and I hate it.\n\nI over-explain myself so that people don't think I do things to be malicious in any way, because over the years I've learned my mental illness gives people inaccurate opinions of me. So now I have a habit of explaining all of my actions to people in an attempt to make them see I have good intentions.\n\nAnyway this resulted in me confessing that I've been having my own issues lately (extreme moodiness, possible depression relapse, heightened anxiety, and maybe almost suicidal??). This was brought up due to me crying, not about what he said. My intention wasn't to take the blame off me, it's just where the conversation went.\n\nI've always had trouble showing how I feel, so I sometimes come off as uncaring or uninterested, and I think that partly contributes to why he never fully told me how he feels about these things he's going through. Although he has been to a couple counselors and they couldn't break that shell either. I don't know why that shell is there in the first place, he's not an 'emotion=weakness' kind of guy.\n\nIt's almost 1am so I'll stop here but long story short I'm just really worried that I'm not doing enough.

I can't stop thinking about death, and I've had three panic attacks in less than a week. I have a history of depression and I'm scared that it's creeping up on me again. It's affecting my job and my relationship. Sometimes I borderline start crying at work, i even had to skip a meeting to cry in my car just because I didn't have my usual notebook with me that day. I'm setting up an appointment w my psychiatrist to ask abt meds, but last time I tried them I gained ~60 pounds. I don't think I'm depressed because I can still function, but I can't get focused/motivated enough to do everything I want.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I both live at home and recently both started work full time so we don't get to see each other as often as we typically would. We don't go out much, but both of us are fine just casually hanging out at his house (I have a big family so we don't get much privacy at mine). A lot of the time he'll voice chat with a mutual friend and play video games while I'm doing my own thing (usually also playing video games). I know that sounds like we're not very close but we're fine just being in each other's company and we don't ignore each other.\n\nHe recently starting planning a dnd campaign with our friends, something I now avoid because my anxiety makes it near-impossible for me to play. So I'm sitting there overhearing half a conversation about building his character and how our gm fudges with game mechanics, etc. Usually I'm fine because I have my laptop to do whatever I want to do, but that day I just couldn't get motivated enough to do anything, I was just silently mad at him because I felt left out; he can work on this campaign whenever he wants and I'm only there for a few hours. So I just sat with my earphones on and music on blast and rhythmically smacking my hand on the armrest of the chair I was in. I guess it made enough noise that my fianc\u00e9 ended the call to ask me what was going on and if I wanted to do something together instead. I told him I don't know what's going on, and that i felt left. I don't remember what we did after but he did manage to make me feel better and calm down.\n\nOn Monday night (10/1) I had a panic attack while applying for jobs and trying to rewrite my resume (my current job is temporary and ends in &lt;2 months). The next night I just had a panic attack for no reason that lasted for hours. I was mad at myself for not being able to calm down despite all the coping strategies I have, for thinking about my fear death and the afterlife all the time, for how I'm falling behind at work and avoiding things I need to do. I fantasize about bad things happening (my relationship falling apart, being kicked out of my home or having a big fight with someone I care about, etc--all of which are unlikely but not impossible), or about dying (if I turn a little harder I could flip the car over, if I fall down the stairs I could break my head open, if I go over the line this oncoming car could hit me directly). Not things I want to happen or plan to do, just things that could easily happen. I don't know if that makes me suicidal, but I think it puts me on the way there.\n\nThis weekend we went to Connecticut to visit friends and on the way there he admitted to some problems he had with our relationship (irrelevant to this, we worked through it), and after I just broke down crying i told him how I've been feeling, and he told me he noticed and was getting concerned. Yesterday I snapped at my friend at breakfast because I said Basque was a country in between Spain and France with its own language, and I thought he and my fianc\u00e9 were laughing at me or at least flabbergasted that I would think that when I'm so clearly wrong. I told both of them to shut up while I looked it up (we were half right, which I told my fianc\u00e9 later; it is part of Spain but operates autonomously from it, and does have its own language/dialect that is a mix of Spanish and french).\n\nI immediately apologized and later told my fianc\u00e9 I thought they were laughing at me but I brushed it off as being hangry so I could drop the subject. I think I got mad at this friend again later though I forget why.\n\nI don't get to see these often, and I did have a good time, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally would because in the background I was so indescribably emotional. On the way home last night I got passive aggressive at my fianc\u00e9 because he changed the song playing ('you're lucky I like this song' I said). He asked if I was mad and tbh I wasn't entirely. I don't know what this emotion is, it's like a mix of boredom, sadness, anxiety, anger, and kind of a fight-or-flight sensation.\n\nEven now I feel lowkey grumpy (maybe even resentful??) toward my fianc\u00e9 for ignoring me even though we're both at home and I'm occupied with other things anyway.\n\nIt might also be important to note that I am currently on my period and been using a hormonal IUD (so my periods are lighter but not gone) for a year, and never as long as I've had periods or this IUD have I been THIS moody, and with mood changes so rapid.\n\nI'm really scared. I keep thinking 'you have all these coping skills you use, so why do you feel this way? You're engaged to someone who loves you warts and all, you're working, you're the most confident about your looks you've ever been, what are you so upset about? You know these feelings are irrational and that's good, but it's been two hours, so stop feeling this way, you have better things to do! You've talked your way through these feelings before, you know how to calm down, so do it already! Be calm! Today was so great, what are you angry about? What are you crying about? You've been in this restaurant bathroom for 20 minutes, people are going to ask questions, what are you gonna tell them? How can you still be like this, we got over this already! Everything's fine! Be fine!'\n\nI've told my fianc\u00e9 all this and he's great about bringing me back, but other than that I have no one to talk to. Idk if he vents to our friends or how much (that's his business and it's fine), but whenever I vent to anyone I just feel like I'm complaining and being dramatic.\n\nI've felt similar to this before and was suicidal then, but I'm pretty sure I'm not suicidal now and this time it feels... different. Like a crooked version of my past breakdowns. I'm going to tell my psychiatrist this, but if he determines I'm suicidal, I might need to be an outpatient at the local/only psych hospital like my brother. Thing is, my fianc\u00e9 works there, in the kitchen. I tell him everything anyway, so even if I don't end up seeing him he's still going to know I'm there--that or I'll just actively avoid every possible way of him finding out, because I hate the thought of him seeing there.

In order to do this I've been restricting my calorie intake to 800-1000 a day, and my carb intake to 90-100 a day. Sometimes it's less than 800 but that's just because of a lack of time to eat or lack of hunger/interest (sometimes my ADHD meds make me not feel hungry and when I try to eat anyway I just get bored of eating and put it away for later or throw it out).\n\nThing is, I'm more or less the most confident I've ever been in my life right now (for reasons other than my weight), I'm even wearing crop tops and booty shorts when I'm out with friends and I look/feel damn good.\n\nNot to mention I love food too much to start eating like, a carrot a day. If anything I'd more easily binge on ten Oreos and just try not to the next day.\n\nI started watching my weight at 193 pounds doing the south beach diet and lost 9 pounds. Then I went to visit friends for the weekend and went up to 187. I hovered between that and 184 for a while and I've just reached 181.\n\nWith the help of the Lose It! app I've been able to track what I eat and, more importantly, how i eat (a five guys burger vs a homemade wrap, for example).\n\nBut ive heard that eating so few calories is dangerous and is a sign of an eating disorder. But as far as I can tell, I'm pretty in control of myself. There are days where I go way over my set limit (although tbh it's not always with the best of choices--sometimes I ate a big steak with lots of broccoli, sometimes it's daiquiris and pizza), but even then it's still between the recommended calorie/carb intake most of the time (sometimes more).\n\nThere are parts of my body I like less than others, and yes this mostly for vanity reasons, although with my genes and premature birth I am at a higher risk for things like diabetes or heart attacks. I've always been meaning to lose this extra weight, it's just that now I'm actively pursuing because of a physical tangible goal. Y'know what I mean? It might not be the healthiest method, but it's not the absolute worst either right? I'm confident that by doing this I'll adopt healthier eating habits and and in order to maintain my target weight, start eating more calories/carbs again.\n\nThat makes sense right?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "loseweight", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfvi", "subreddit_subscribers": 6204, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can I get an eating disorder i have good self-esteem?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loseweight/comments/9lneza/can_i_get_an_eating_disorder_i_have_good/"}, {"author": "aunclesquishy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ykaanr", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538703498, "domain": "self.AnimalCrossing", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/9li0zm/is_it_just_me/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9li0zm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "NL", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Leaf"}], "link_flair_template_id": "1913d8d0-6d76-11e5-aa4f-0e7eccdaeabd", "link_flair_text": "New Leaf", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/9li0zm/is_it_just_me/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538703499, "score": 1, "selftext": "or do villagers not interact with each other as much as in previous games?

Can someone truly not be depressed anymore? Or does depression just go dormant and may or may not relapse?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was diagnosed with moderate major depression five years ago. I was a sophomore in college with no friends, in a long-distance and unhealthy (and secret) relationship, and flunking classes  because I was avoiding them due uncontrolled anxiety. I was diagnosed with Nonverbal Learning Disability, Executive Dysfunction, Dermatillomania (a form of OCD), ADHD, General Anxiety Disorder, and moderate Major Depression (some of these things were already diagnosed, some weren't, the depression wasn't). I didn't actually get the report til a couple months despite being evaluated five years ago, but that's another story.  \n\n\nAnyway, I had been depressed in my freshman/sophomore years of high school as well, and even suicidal, though I managed to pull myself out of it without telling anyone I was hurting.  \n\n\nI started dating my now-fiance around this time (after ending my previous relationship). I don't know how he managed to stick by me for over 4 years and decide he wants to forever, but I'm not complaining. ...I mean I guess I know, my self-esteem has actually been really good the past few years (partly because of my relationship, but more because of how my fiance has helped and supported me through my difficult times). I'm just surprised by all his patience considering how much time I've spent crying and panicking over the littlest things, sometimes for no reason at all. And I know it's just my anxiety etc making me feel this way, that it's just a chemical imbalance that has me crying because I took more than 5 seconds to answer a question (it's why I can't play tabletops, as much as I really REALLY want to, but that's anothter post for another time).  \n\n\nAnyway I have a job with Americorps that's ending in about two months. After I graduated college, I spent a year just sitting around sad that I couldn't find a job. That's when I joined Americorps, and while I've started applying to jobs I'm pretty sure I'm qualified for, and after my service is done I'm going to start taking classes to chase my dream of working in animation that I was too scared to pursue in college. So I'm pretty excited that I have a plan, but since I barely graduated college with a 2.1 gpa, and I've floundered a lot in my current 'job' (it's technically volunteer work), I'm terrified that I'm going fail at these things.  \n\n\nI could technically apply for disability, except there's little funding right now so I'd be put on a waiting list, and like, I could function on my own, I think. It's hard to explain--I have developmental diabilities that make things very difficult for me that would be easy and obvious to others. Cognitively I'm fine, and up until now that's how I've been plowing through my issues. \"This is just my anxiety talking,\" and then I'll make a list of each irrational thought and kind of debate with myself and talk myself through all my thoughts. And that's helped so much but lately it's slowly becoming less effective.  \n\n\nI think about death all the time. I've dealt with Dermatillomania (skin-picking) since I was 12, and wearing makeup and developing a regular and consistent skincare routine has done wonders. I pick SO much less now (I haven't stopped by a long shot, but I've improved so much), but now I think my OCD is just manifesting in another way. Sort of an \"out of the frying pan\" situation, I think. Before picking it was hair-pulling, and before that it was needing things to be even (if I brushed my right hand against the table, then I need to do it with my left hand too at the exact same angle and level of contact). So I guess now it's thinking of death.  \n\n\nThe thought of there being absolutely no afterlife TERRIFIES me, I HATE the thought of just no longer existing in any way. I've started keeping track like \"I'm 25 now, and the average American woman lives to about 82, but my great-grandmother lived to be in her 90s, and my grandmother is in her 70s now and looks pretty good, so I'll probably last till my 90s, that gives me about 65 years left, MAYBe.\"  \n\n\nI noticed myself getting depressed/lowkey death-obsessed in February, and especially April, but I started perking back up in May. Work was really stressful at the time as well and these moods kind of went along with work-stress. One of my supervisors noticed too because I kept coming in over an hour late (because I was panicking), and while I didn't want to tell her everything, I did mention that anxiety had been getting to me (she's a doctor so she was pretty understanding, but she's also very no-nonsense, so that understanding only goes so far).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[I've taken a break from typing and managed to stop crying so now I feel 'fine' and mostly tired (I need to get to sleep anyway) so like, all the text above was mid-panic attack, all text now is post. If that makes a difference, idk, I'll just try to sum up and make a long story short, I need to sleep.\\]  \n\n\nI think I'm depressed. And I'm so scared. I tried anxiety meds in the past but it ended up worse AND I gained \\~50 pounds, (which I'm struggling to lose now but I am making progress now that I have a tangible goal what with the upcoming wedding, I'm still very happy about that), so I'm open to trying another one, and I guess an antidepressant if need be. I really want to get evaluated again so I can have up-to-date report, if only so I know what's going on, at least.  \n\n\nI'm worried that my psychiatrist will think I'm suicidal. I know this probably won't happen, but I have this scenario in my head that I'd be submitted as an inpatient at the local psych hospital, which would be really upsetting for me since my fiance works in the kitchen and sometimes goes to collect dishes or something, I forget. He's seen me at my worst, but I would never want him to see me like that. Not to mention I wouldn't his family knowing. They all love me and all, but I wouldn't want them getting a wrong impression of me. I try very hard to seem like I'm not falling apart, even if I'm not the best at it.  \n\n\nI was at my lowest when I started dating my fiance because for the past few years before and since then, my relationship with my own family was in pieces. I had just been diagnosed with epilepsy as well as Nonverbal Learning Disability, and I couldn't see why I wasn't allowed to close my own bedroom door and have some privacy, or why everybody judged me so harshly. It was for a lot of reasons, and everybody was going through their own things, but part of it was during that most recent seizure, I was in the car with my siblings, and I was literally spasming on top of my youngest sister, who was still just a kid. My youger sister called 911, rode with me in the ambulance--she was only a freshman in high school but she had to grow up fast that day. There were many more factors and I've spent the last couple years trying to heal those relationships. Progress is slow, but it's progress.  \n\n\nI knew some new low would be coming, because I fluctuate between perfectly fine and rock-bottom. I wouldn't say I'm at rock bottom now, but I'm sliding.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 392239, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I'm depressed again (long/kind of disorganized post)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9kxgte/i_think_im_depressed_again_longkind_of/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "aunclesquishy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ykaanr", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537286592, "domain": "self.Preterms", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Preterms/comments/9gw4id/adult_25weeker_looking_for_therapy/", "id": "9gw4id", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Preterms/comments/9gw4id/adult_25weeker_looking_for_therapy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1537286593, "score": 1, "selftext": "TLDR: i need a preemie-specializing therapist in Rhode Island, or at least Massachusetts or Connecticut, but I don't know what to search for specifically\n\nMy whole life, my mother has struggled getting adequate health resources and therapy.

She's blind, arthritic, has accidents in the house (she literally just pooped as I was bathing her and has done so in her bed twice at night and not moved from it), gets confused and anxious if Im not with her and so starts barking until I pet/hold her, and this has been happening in the middle of the night for maybe over a year now. She sleeps all day and almost never wags her tail anymore. My younger brother especially has been stonewalling me, but we finally came to an agreement albeit with a lot of conditions that lean in his favor. I'm so close to getting the green light, but he wants us to keep her ashes, and that's the thing that bothers me most. Currently I live at home but I plan to move out within the next year. I don't like the idea of someone else in the family keeping her ashes because it's my dog, but at the same time I really don't want to keep her ashes at all. I've been pre-grieving this dog for so long (i made an appointment to put her down in May, then had to cancel to ~protect my brothers feelings~ and have not been able to do anything since), I just want to put her out of her misery and be done with it. We agreed to do it after her birthday which is this Thursday and now that it's getting closer and becoming more real, I don't think I'm as ready as I thought. But honestly at this point not only am I sad about my dog but now I have some resentment toward my family for essentially forcing her to suffer so they can feel comfortable. I tried to at least schedule a checkup to see if there's anything seriously wrong and how we can make the dog more comfortable, but my mom said not to because 'vet appointments are expensive and what's the point if you're just going to put her down anyway?' This isn't going at all like I hoped it would and I'm essentially being forced to watch my dog fall apart and I'm the only one that has to deal with it because nobody else cares enough to help. Last time I tried discussing it with my parents they just yelled at me and called me cruel, among other things.

I mean, in the end it's about fun but then again I'd love to be able to fully immerse myself, y'know?\n\nI feel like there's a lot of options yet at the same time I don't even rly know what those options are.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "sca", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhzo", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Persona/costume for a woman torn between being dainty vs being badass", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sca/comments/6sdpad/personacostume_for_a_woman_torn_between_being/", "view_count": null}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "aunclesquishy", "author_flair_css_class": "AVISTA", "author_flair_text": "VISTA", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501448337, "domain": "self.AmeriCorps", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmeriCorps/comments/6qjuvj/i_dont_have_to_relocate_but_i_think_i_want_to/", "id": "6qjuvj", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "VISTA", "link_flair_text": "VISTA", "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/AmeriCorps/comments/6qjuvj/i_dont_have_to_relocate_but_i_think_i_want_to/", "retrieved_on": 1502162543, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just got accepted to a VISTA program within my state, and it's within a half-hour drive of my house (I'm 24 and I live at home). Since I live <50 miles away, I wouldn't be provided with a relocation allowance but I do still get the living allowance that, in theory, would be enough to cover utilities and such.\n\nSince I live close enough to the area that I don't really need to live there (unlike if I were to be working like, across the country or something), I could just live at home and keep my provided 'living allowance' in my savings account to use for whatever else.\n\nBut then again, according to the VISTA website, they strongly suggest that you move into the area regardless, and basically live like the people you'd be serving. I think it would be a good experience to at least try and live there using my allowance and such, and most likely go on food stamps. It would be my first time living on my own, which up until now I have been unable to do. And then if something comes up, I guess I could always just move back home but remain in the VISTA program. Then again, I don't really know how apartment leases work, isn't there one where like you sign a contract so you have live in the apartment for a year or something? If nothing else I at least have a safety net because my family is so close by anyway.\n\nOn the one hand, I think since I have the option of just saving the money for the future, that might be good. But if I do that, I wouldn't get ~the full experience~ and I think I would miss out on something. Like, if I don't really get fully into it, I might as well just be doing a paid internship or something. One of the people who interviewed me told me he was a volunteer in the 70s and he LOVED it. He got a place, went on food stamps (\"I was able to eat duck, where before that I was living on noodles\"), and he said the whole thing was an amazing experience for him.\n\nI'm gonna talk to my boyfriend and see if he might be interested in moving in with me (which would really help with rent since he's got a part-time job). But regardless of what he says, idk. I feel like both options have advantages and disadvantages.

I'm giving him some scars so I have a visual on where it rips, essentially seams.\n\nOriginally I had them going down the front of his body and his face, branching off up/ down his arms and legs, and going between his fingers and toes (right under his nails). The 'seam' would end between his ears (from behind), his shoulder blades, and the ones from his legs would meet at the end of his tail (which doesn't really make sense, now that I think about it). It looked cool but then he (in his skin) would have to step back and around his 'dead' body, and that just looks awkward. I want him to be able to step forward to simplify things.\n\nSo now I'm thinking this: the scar starts at his forehead head and down the spine. It goes up his tail and then back down the other side (so the tail-scars are on the bottom, not the sides).\n\nUnder the base of his tail, it splits and goes down each leg. When it gets to the bottom of his feet, it branches off underneath each toe, up to the bottom of the toenail.\n\nThe spinal scar also splits at shoulder blade-level and goes down his arms. From the back of his shoulders, triceps, and winds around to the back of his hands (knuckle-side). It splits at the wrist and up to his fingers, and ends at the base of his nails, top-side (rather than underneath, unlike his toes).\n\nI think with this new set-up, he might be able to just step forward, since from behind he's all cut apart, like taking off a jacket except backwards.\n\n(It might be worth noting that while he has/will never use(d) this on himself in combat, it is one of the first extracts he experimented with when he started learning plague alchemy.)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2trms", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "The best ways to rip your skin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/6n9757/the_best_ways_to_rip_your_skin/", "view_count": null}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "aunclesquishy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1499960648, "domain": "self.Pathfinder_RPG", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/6n2ezm/chaoticanxietylawful_my_plaguebringer_is_a_weeny/", "id": "6n2ezm", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/6n2ezm/chaoticanxietylawful_my_plaguebringer_is_a_weeny/", "retrieved_on": 1502099368, "score": 7, "selftext": "To summarize his backstory, my ratfolk (his name is Geg) apprenticed under his alchemist mom growing up, and basically both of them were the warren medics. He was picked on by the rest of the warren for being a nerdy little wimp; his strength and charisma are garbage but his dexterity and intelligence are great.\n\nEventually he decided to prove that he's a badass, and started getting into plague alchemy. He'd secretly steal books and listen in on other alchemists, things like that. When it comes to using diseases and such to his advantage, he's mostly self-taught, but he already had a solid foundation with what he already knew of alchemy and was able to adapt to the new material.\n\nHe experimented at night when no one could see what he was up to, and was caught one evening flayed on the floor and his skin walkin' around on its own (skinsend). They found the stash of disease and bomb materials/books/etc he kept in a holeunder a tile under his bed. So, he was kicked out because everyone believed he was only confirming all the stereotypes that ratfolk are just disgusting thieving fleabags. (Luckily, he was able to keep all his stuff because they didn't want to risk someone else finding it and messing around with plague and bombs like he did.)\n\nWith extracts like 'skinsend,' 'touch injection,'* and 'vomit swarm,' he's just generally disgusting and could be absolutely terrifying if he weren't so insecure and sheltered (so there's room for character development, which is always fun).\n\nBeliefs-wise, I guess he doesn't care much about laws. I feel like he has potential to be really chaotic, he just doesn't know how, y'know? If he knows he can't get caught, I'd say he'd veer somewhere between chaotic good and chaotic neutral. He doesn't naturally go out of his way to help anyone whenever he can however he can, but if somebody asked he doesn't know how to say 'no.'\n\nOn one hand, 'nervous=/=good' necessarily, but his anxiety is what keeps him--at least for now--from being the 'chaotic something' he might be deep down. Chaotic in progress or something, I guess.\n\nObviously he has SOME disregard for laws and rules etc., since he's worked so hard to be able to infect people literal plague despite it being HEAVILY frowned upon. For now I've been going with 'neutral good,' but I guess it's closer to 'chaotic eh.' Like, he's pretty indifferent as long as he can save his own skin and have nobody bother him. He doesn't have much ambition except honing his skills and learning more about his interests, whether they're strictly legal or not. He doesn't like the idea of innocent bystanders getting hurt but he doesn't really do much to protect people, either; it's more of an afterthought. 'I blew up the guy trying to kill me in this town but it never really occured to me these irrelevant people who are not in my party might get hurt, drat.'\n\n*This is a great combo by the way. Using skinsend on myself in combat is suicide, but with touch injection I can rip other people from their own skin and significantly weaken them the same way it would have affected me (strength goes down to 3, consititution debuff, half of their current HP, body's HP is zero, etc.).\n\nI'd appreciate any and all help, sorry if this got a little redundant but I hope I explained it okay!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2trms", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Chaotic+anxiety=Lawful?
