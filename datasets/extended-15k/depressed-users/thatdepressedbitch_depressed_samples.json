I\u2019ve always been a high achieving student and have been looking forward to and working toward university for as long as I can remember. I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 16 and have been dealing with it ever since. It has had an increasing impact on my academics, but I have always been able to manage it and was able to be accepted into the university I wanted to attend. \n\nI\u2019m almost three months into my first year and I\u2019ve crashed. I\u2019ve already had to drop a course and I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t be able to successfully complete my year at this rate. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to motivate myself to go to class when I don\u2019t know how to get myself out of bed in the morning. As for studying, I have hours of work I need to get done tonight and I\u2019ve been staring at it for the last three hours, unable to do it. Every time I start, my head starts buzzing until I feel like I\u2019m about to explode and I start hyperventilating. I feel just empty all the time, which I\u2019m used to, but I stare at the ceiling in bed all day and can\u2019t be motivated to watch Netflix, much yet start writing a paper. \n\nI\u2019ve never felt more alone in my life, but I figure that there must be other university students that deal with the same issues.
