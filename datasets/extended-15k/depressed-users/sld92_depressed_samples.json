I have insomnia because of the pills and I end up sleeping during the day.\n\nI feel apathetic, and unmotivated (not when working out though, I like pushing the weights). I have good grades at uni, but I have less and less motivation. I don't feel like eating but I manage to eat fat/protein-dense food to avoid loosing too much weight as I'm already underweight. I always been driven in life but for the last eight years, I've felt apathetic and alienated. I'm thinking about moving from the city/uni to another one, but I have a lease for at least 8 other months. I don't want to fail, but I feel like giving up all the time.\n\nI spend my days mostly on youtube watching videos. I also get lost in fantasy books, and do feel good when I do. But I have a life to take care of and I feel like I'm not responsible enough and I care but not enough, it seems, to make any effort. At the same time, as I'm re-reading what I already wrote, it seems to me that I'm making a lot of effort, but it drives me insane to have a mood disorder. I feel like I need to go someplace but I don't know where. Whenever I think about myself or my responsibilities I feel so tired. I notice things I should do, but I don't do them. I don't even pretend I'll do them some other time. I feel shame for being like that. I don't know what else there is to do... I don't want to kill myself, it's too extreme for me, and I'm too anxious to do it, but I often wish I was dead. I feel disconnected from life, isolated, alienated. Everything seems pointless. I wish I was positive and fierce and I would have some grit, but I'm worn down. I barely feel connected to my friends. I wish I was peaceful, but I'm not. I wish I would wake up at 7 and be productive, but I barely sleep before 4-5 am, or when I do, I wake up 3 hours later.My GP prescribed me antipsychotics to help me sleep because they induce drowsiness, but the side-effects are too much to handle and the pharmacist told me that a lot of doctors are not advising against this off-label use.\n\nI'm diagnosed with GAD and MDD and I'm on the spectrum, but I've had periods in my life where I was very social  and strangely enough, people don't seem to dislike me despite my quirks.

I feel really lost.\n\nI mean there is not much that anyone can do, but I wonder if you have advices for things that worked for you ?

Here's the situation : I'm a 26 yo male and my mental and physical health have been going downhill for the last eight years, when I started to get very severe panic attacks every night. Then the panic attacks disappeared after a few months, but I was anxious again. Then I started to loose hair, not a lot, but very slowly, then I started to notice that my face was always dry. I used to be able to go out without a jacket outside during winter when I was a teenager (I live in Canada) and I could drink coffee like mad and fall asleep. Now I can barely tolerate the air-conditioner and a sip of coffee gives me the jitters. And I have this brain fog that doesn't lift up and I'm depressed, apathetic and lethargic. For a while I took antidepressants for anxiety/depression, but the mental fog was still there and I weaned off them gradually. Now I feel a bit better, but I'm still not able to concentrate. Besides I have difficulty digesting food and I have lost most of my appetite. I'm always tired whatever I do and can't find any enjoyment in the activites I used to enjoy. I don't have the problems with weight gain, but I am underweight (139 lbs for 6') and I haven't noticed any goiter but I have difficulty swallowing.\n\nThe thing is, my mother has Hashimoto and my grandmother too. And I've started to think that's what I have. When I saw my family doctor, he ordrered blood tests but he checked only my TSH, which came out in the normal range. Now, I've got an appointment with another doctor and I will tell him that I suspect Hashimoto. But the appointment is three weeks and I'm going back to uni starting a new program in STEM, which requires a lot of concentration. And I really worried about my ability to perform and keep my GPA in the range I'm used to, besides my life is hell and I feel like I'm in prison and waiting to get out.\n\nWhat are you thoughts on the situation and what would you recommend?

I haven't graduated from college (I'm currently in between High School and University). I'm supposed to enter uni next year. I have a job, with a somewhat decent pay. However, I find myself unable to work a lot, being disgusted by what I do. I spend hours procrastinating and it can go on. I don't want to be fired. I try to find motivation, but when I do, I feel like I am bullshitting myself. Besides, I work with my brother and he acts like an asshole with me. Most of the time, I get stuck on tasks and feel overwhelmed. \n\nI want to study art and I want to make art. I don't care for anything else, however I've got bills to pay. I'm somewhat optimistic for the future, however for now, I don't know what to do. I have had many jobs and I am (objectively) not really good at working because I don't really care or even if I care, a regular job is overwhelming for me, emotionally speaking. I don't like the idea of receiving orders and being told what to do. I am afraid of leaving my job but I feel I should. But I don't know what kind of other job I can find.\n\nI feel alone, secluded, as most of my friends are going through life and I feel like I'm still 17. I feel I've been robbed of the last 6 years. If I had completed college, I would have had my education as an asset and I could work toward being a freelance artist. However, I've started so much different projects that failed that I have still a lot of work to do to have the minimum skills to start producing art. I'm fairly good at drawing and I work daily on it. Working on my techniques, etc.\n\nI feel stuck. And I hate the corporate world. And my friends are gone. And I'm getting older and I'm not moving, or only starting to move (a little). I don't know what to do. I feel like shit. I've had a depression relapse this winter and had to move back to my mother's. Now I'm in an apartment with one of my friend's friend. It's great, but I feel like I'm not doing enough. I wish I could focus on the positive but it feels like being dishonest and not facing reality. And my goal is not to become a happy idiot.\n\nI've tried discussing this issue with friends, but they got bored of it and told me it was hard for them to help me. And they started to avoid me. That made me feel like shit. But I understand why they do that. However, I feel like I am alone. I wish I could talk to my parents about it, but they don't understand: I tried so many times I've given up the idea of them encouraging me.\n\nTo be honest, I don't feel appreciated and sometimes I wonder if I am not acting like an asshole because of my difficulty to relate to people. I have always been rejected since I was a child, spending more time alone than with friends. I was unable to communicate with others. They found me weird. And I feel that my social skills are lacking. But when I observe how people act and the social norms in our society, I'm pissed and I don't want to participate in this collective hypocrisy.\n\nI'm pissed, sad, angry, desperate. I don't know what I can do.
