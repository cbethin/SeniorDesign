My body is sore, it's hard to breathe, like there is a weight on my chest. The only thing I want to do is lay in a bed, close my eyes and never wake. Life is not fun, it's not joyful, its full of pain. \n\nA year ago I broke my leg, immediately my foot started to hurt, burn, turn red, and swell. I have had X-rays and MRI on my foot and leg to find the cause. Finally, I was diagnosed with CRPS after I found a pain specialist on my own when my doctor wouldn't take my pain seriously. I have had two nerve blocks that lasted less than two days each. We have tried opioids, which are not a long-term solution, Lyrica/gabapentin that didn't help the pain but caused me very bad mental side effects.  The most recent surgery installed a nerve stimulator that has had no effect. Despite working with the nerve stimulator representative, trying different settings, the pain, redness, stiffness, swelling is still there. I\u2019ve had the nerve stimulator since September. The nerve stimulator rep recommended ibuprofen like I haven't tried taking 800mg of it before.   \n\nYesterday I saw my pain specialist for what I\u2019m sure is going to be one of the last times. He questioned my pain levels and how much the nerve stimulator is working for me. He told me that I should turn it off so I can feel what my baseline pain is. I told him we (the rep and I) did that a couple of weeks ago and I couldn\u2019t feel the difference when the machine was off or on. My doctor gave me the impression without outright saying it that the nerve stimulator was the last shot and the final instrument we could use to help with the pain. I also don\u2019t have high hopes and clearly, he doesn't either that it will help. \n\n\nHe then asked if I have tried hiking, I told him yes I did ten excruciating miles two weeks ago. He then told me that was a good sign and that my foot pain must not be very bad. And I should be happy I can still hike compared to his other patients that cannot hike because of age, I\u2019m 32. \n\nI did the hike despite the pain, following my psychologist's advisement to help with depression and suicidal thoughts. I did the hike because I wanted to spend time with a great hiking friend that I haven't seen in over a year. I did the hike because I wanted to spend time outside my house that is empty because I\u2019m selling it because I have been out of work. I did the hike because hiking used to be my life, it used to bring me such happiness, calm and sense of accomplishment. Stress, anxiety, and problems used to melt away mile after mile that passed beneath my shoes. I used to hike hundreds of miles every year, 20 miles in a day with a 40lb pack was normal and I could do it day after day. I did the hike because I needed to. \n\nDespite the pain I agreed to do the hike, Despite the pain, I did the first 2 miles. The pain increased. The next 3 miles every step was followed by clenched teeth and a death grip on my hiking poles. When we got to the lake we were heading to I couldn't think straight I was mentally exhausted and nauseous. On the way back I don't remember much of the hike not able to think through the pain of every step. I followed my friend down the trail, despite in the past I would usually have to take a break every couple of miles to let her catch up, she was leaving me in the dust. \n\nOne point I stopped, my friend was ahead and out of sight around the next bend in the trail. I looked off the trail into the woods. I questioned how cold it would be getting during the night at this time of year and elevation. I wondered if it would be cold enough to kill someone if they didn\u2019t use a coat. I wondered if death would happen quickly. Death would happen quickly if the person laid down in the creek. And I considered walking off the trail, disappearing forever, finding a pool deep enough for me to lay down in. Watching the sunset, letting the coolness of the night set in, taking off my coat, shirt and pants and laying down in the creek and letting the darkness take over. I\u2019m tired of the pain, tired of the depression, tired of being tired. I didn't want to cause my friend pain so I turned and followed her down the trail. The nights are getting colder and it would happen so much quicker.  \n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 403743, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My doctor is out of options and grasping for straws.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9vn2d9/my_doctor_is_out_of_options_and_grasping_for/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "crps_throwaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_x1eut3e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541788402, "domain": "self.CRPS", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CRPS/comments/9vmz8y/my_doctor_is_out_of_options_and_grasping_for/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9vmz8y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CRPS/comments/9vmz8y/my_doctor_is_out_of_options_and_grasping_for/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1541788404, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m tired, it doesn't matter how much sleep I try to get.

I was very very active, being able to bike, MTB, run, hike, workout... nearly every day. I lost the best girl I've ever known. I'm in constant pain, sitting, standing or walking make the pain unbearable. I get 5hrs of sleep a night, I'm always exhausted. I'm out of work with my savings nearly gone. This condition has completely changed me. I was happy, I had friends. I cannot spent time with my friends, I don't have the energy to go out and they cannot help me. The thought of a nerve block to reset my nervous system was the only thing for the last month that kept my hopes alive. My doctors have done a nerve block which gave me 24hrs of being completely pain free. I was able to walk my dog, I was able to sleep, I went for a short hike in the mountains near my home where I used to spend hours biking, or running, or backpacking in. By 48hrs I was in excruciating pain and I was confined to bed again. It took most of the night for my pain to reduce before I could sleep. My doctors are going to order another nerve block which will probably take place in several weeks, if insurance approves it. But it just doesn't feel worth it to be in pain anymore just to have hope for a day without pain.

Next several weeks leg pain and sleep improved but foot pain, swelling, and discoloration became severe especially if the foot was not kept elevated.

Sitting longer for more than 15 min causes foot pain, swelling and discoloration take several hours of elevation to improve. \n\nDisability kept getting pushed back, was scheduled to end on Feb 8th, was going to push back more.
