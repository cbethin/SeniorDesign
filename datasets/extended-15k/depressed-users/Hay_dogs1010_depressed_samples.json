I was diagnosed with MDD(major depressive disorder) last year so I\u2019m generally quite sympathetic. It all started last year. My friend (I\u2019ll call him adam) was a very normal kid. I finally managed to tell him about my struggles with depression. He said that\u2019s awful and I felt relief. The day after though, he told everyone in my grade he had depression and they all needed to be nice to him. At first I was skeptical because it was right after I opened up. He then missed the next day of school and was texting everyone it was because he was depressed. Later he texted me it was because he wanted people to pay attention to him. Anyway this happened for months and everyone knew it was fake (and please don\u2019t try to tell me it might be real, it really wasn\u2019t and in summer who said he was doing it all as a prank) More proof it\u2019s fake is apparently the day after I told him about my MDD he saw a therapist who diagnosed him also with MDD within 30 minutes, which pretty much never happens. He also fell at my house and cut his knee and texted a photo to everyone claiming it was \u2018self harm\u2019. Anyways, all this finally stopped after he admitted it but not he\u2019s starting to blurt it out again and tell everybody he\u2019s depressed when it\u2019s clear it isn\u2019t again. This has been so stressful for me and even lead to my suicide attempt. I don\u2019t know what to do.
