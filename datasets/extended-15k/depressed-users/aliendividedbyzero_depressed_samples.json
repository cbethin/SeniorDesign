I understand that inner worlds are sort of... a meeting place for the different parts of the mind to come together and perhaps process? trauma in a safe space, interact with each other, and exist safely. Therefore, it seemed like it's not really something that would appear in non-multiple people (I'm not sure what the correct term for that is, but I mean people that don't have alters partially or fully distinguished, so there's no need to have a place for them to reunite).\n\nHowever, a recent development in my own life made me challenge that idea I had. I don't (to my knowledge) have any alters. I've not been diagnosed with DID or OSDD. However, as a result of trauma, I *do* dissociate pretty often. It's not severe enough to cause a switch, I don't think, but it is enough to be quite disorienting and noticeable for my friends and people who are closer to me and can see the difference in my behavior. I noticed that, while in my waking life I do not have an inner world like I've heard systems describe, I do have a very similar place in my dreams. I clarify (in bullets because it's easier for me to organize my thoughts that way):\n\n* Most of the people I have talked to seem to dream, more or less frequently as varying by the person. I'm on the \"I dream every single night\" end of the spectrum, and on the \"I have nightmares very often\" end of the spectrum. I've spoken to friends and family and they all seem to be at varying places with regards to that.\n* Most of the people I've talked to say that their dreams seem pretty random. Occasionally their dreams will happen in places from the real world, whether they look exactly the same or are different, but that there doesn't seem to be much consistency to it. It's very random, to them. I myself have dreams like that, too.\n* However, and most often, I also have dreams that seem to all happen in the same \"world,\" so to speak. There's a sense of consistency and continuation to those dreams, almost like it's all happening in the same life if that makes sense. Places those dreams happen in are connected and are extremely consistent in what they look like and what their layout is. Some are real places, some are not. The places from the real world are almost always different from the real ones in some way, but if they are, then they're always different in the exact same way, to the point where I can draw a map if I want to, or I could paint the place if I wanted to. If I find something in that place in one dream, then in another night's dream, I could go back and find that exact same thing in that exact same place (unless an NPC moves it, I guess).\n\nSo that has led me to think it's a form of an \"inner world,\" which I thought strange because as I mentioned earlier, I don't think I have any alters, as far as I'm aware of. Maybe there's a sense of there being \"parts\" of me, but they're not distinct enough to be considered separate personalities. Moreso... they're just like types of reactions I have to things, due to trauma, which are different from how I'd normally expect to react to a situation, but are all consistently **me** enough that I don't think it's necessary to deem them separate. So, I thought, there's no reason for me to have an inner world like that, regardless of whether I access it only in my dreams or not. I've tried looking for information on the subject but no one has really talked about anything like this on the internet, as far as I can tell. If you have any information I could read, please do link it! And if you have any similar experiences, please let me know! I'd love to hear what other people think about this and what your thoughts are.\n\nTL;DR- Can people that don't have dissociative systems (aka, people without alters) have inner worlds too? Is that a thing, if the person has gone through trauma and experiences dissociation as a result of the trauma? Worth mentioning that none of the people who don't dissociate that I've asked this question to seem to have anything like it, but I seem to have an inner world in my dreams.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Dissociation", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xt3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 1591, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Inner Worlds and Dissociative Disorders", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Dissociation/comments/9yw0lb/inner_worlds_and_dissociative_disorders/"}, {"author": "aliendividedbyzero", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_163r9d", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538579411, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9l20nc/question_about_depression_and_grief/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9l20nc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9l20nc/question_about_depression_and_grief/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538579415, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everybody! I've been diagnosed with depression recently, although I have been suffering from it for years now.

Then my grandpa died in April, and despite being sad about that for obvious reasons, things didn't quite go as I expected. I was expecting to become even more depressed as a result of grief, thinking people tend to become sad, numb, etc. after the death of a loved one. However, instead of feeling more depressed, my depressive episode ended and I felt, instead, better than I had felt all year. I was happy, ready to tackle anything the world could throw at me, and just generally feeling great. Of course, any thought about my grandpa did make me miss him and made me sad about his passing, but... it wasn't as awful as people often describe grief to be. Is this an unusual reaction or has this happened to any of you? Have any of you suffered a loss like that while depressed, such that you could describe how grieving was for you? I'm mostly just curious; it's not really something I've wanted to talk about to my friends or family. \n\nTL;DR- grandpa whom I loved dearly passed away while I was in severe depression, and instead of making my depression worse, I felt amazing (though occasionally sad about the loss).

My psychiatrist asked me to keep a journal to show her how I've been feeling between appointments, and one of the things she asked me to keep track of is my mood, obviously. I'm working on making my own mood chart so that it includes the information I think is important to report and excludes information I think is redundant or does not apply in my case.\n\nHowever... I've run into a problem: I want to have the mood chart be such that once it's filled over a period of time, you can see the moods as a line graph. For this reason, I decided to keep mood and energy separate from each other (since that would allow me to track mixed episodes as well). I don't know how exactly to quantify the moods and energy though. I'd like to be able to write down what each number, say from 0-10, means so that my psychiatrist better understands how I've been feeling. I'm just struggling to find any description of what each number could represent, since it seems all charts go with \"mild, moderate, severe\" or \"not impairing, sort of impairing, severely impairing\" or an alternate version of that. I want something with more description so that I can tell her: \"look, I've been feeling like this; these are the symptoms I've been experiencing and how much I've been experiencing them.\"\n\nI'm looking for something kind of like [this](https://www.bipolaruk.org/FAQs/mood-scale).

For context, the medication I'm referring to is the antidepressant I'm currently on: Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion), 100mg once a day. I don't think I was speaking particularly faster than usual in this audio but I did keep interrupting myself (I've tried to let the grammar and spelling reflect this, so note that the mistakes are deliberate to show what it sounds like) and I kept going off in tangents, which is a huge thing hypomanic me likes to do. I think the most hilarious part is that it took me 3 minutes to say that I ate lettuce and it was bitter but the oranges were sweet xD\n\nTranscript:\n&gt;Listen, I am\u2026 so mad, I just [giggling] I just ate lunch it\u2019s like 5pm but I just ate lunch because I woke up at um\u2026 I went to bed at 4am, um, cause I couldn\u2019t sleep, and because I was watching Netflix and because- yeah I-I just wasn\u2019t tired and then, I woke up at like 11 [giggling] I woke up at 11 and had breakfast at 11. And so-I\u2019ve been, um- Honestly wasting time, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing? But anyway I just had lunch- [laughing] and I\u2019m so mad *because\u2026* um, I had\u2026 I haven\u2019t had a salad in like ages \u2018cause I just- salads take effort to make, you know what I mean, and like, depression and stuff an- [giggling] so I made- [giggling] and I made a salad, cause I went to the\u2026 um\u2026 Several days ago. Was it several days a- It was a while ago, I think. Um, yeah like several days ago. I- I went to the grocery store and I bought lettuce. I bought lettuce. I bought lettuces because, mine\u2026 [sounding distracted] I had to throw them away because they were all like *old,* y\u2019know. I don\u2019t wanna eat old lettuce so I bought new lettuce aaand I bought oranges, and I bought\u2026 apples and I bought bananas- but I already ate the bananas. And I bought, um\u2026 What else did I buy, I bought yogurt\u2026 kiwi, and mango- I didn\u2019t buy apples, I already had the apples [unintelligible word, I think I was trying to say \u201cit was\u201d]. Uhh\u2026 But anyway so I made a salad toda- [laughing] I made a fucking salad. And I\u2019m SO MAD because- I actually like salad, I don\u2019t mind the taste of lettuce like I\u2019ve s- I\u2019ve eaten straight-up lettuce y\u2019know what I mean but, like straight-up lettuce with tuna, um- tuna salad [laughing] and I\u2019ve eaten um, lettuce just like\u2026 salad lettuce?Idunno what I\u2019m saying anymore but the point is that I don\u2019t *mind the taste of lettuce.* But, *today,* I ate the salad and I haven\u2019t eaten a salad in like ages so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s- if it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not used to it again or if it\u2019s like\u2026 *the medication* or something but it tasted like complete shit. [laughing] Just like\u2026 so damn bitter! Like nooo! I didn\u2019t sign up for that! I\u2019m-I\u2019m supposed to be eating you know good food, and and lettuce is like [or \"a\". can't tell] good food and I- It can\u2019t- you know I- I ate it because I\u2019m an adult and I have to adult you know? But.. UGH! It was- It was-It sucked. It sucked, it tasted really bitter, like I\u2026 I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t even. But! I did eat it with orange.

I'm new to this whole antidepressants thing. My doctor switched me off the Prozac that my GP had prescribed and put me on Wellbutrin (100mg for 14 days and then 150mg for 14 days, but she said I can ask for more 100mg if I prefer to stay at the lower dose for a while longer). This was because I was having side effects from the Prozac, particularly alarming: mood swings that I *think* were rapid cycling. There's several red flags indicating I might be bipolar II, but she doesn't want to diagnose that or put me on lithium until she's absolutely sure. She said that Wellbutrin is safer than Prozac in my case because Prozac has a longer half-life and so it'd be easier to stop the Wellbutrin and bring me down from a manic episode if that were to happen than it would be on Prozac.\n\nSo that being said, I have questions. Is 1 week too short to start feeling positive effects from Wellbutrin? The first 2-3 days I got a pretty distinct 'high', just like I did when I started Prozac. That 'high' consisted of me being a lot more talkative, laughing at just about anything, cracking jokes, and having more energy. I couldn't sleep. But I didn't experience racing thoughts or reckless behavior, or pressured speech. Then I went down to feeling pretty 'meh' for another day or two (not as bad as the depression the Wellbutrin is meant to be treating though). Now I'm on the 5th or 6th day iirc and I've been feeling great for two days in a row now. I'm super motivated to do things (and indeed have been very productive), I can actually concentrate again (one of my main symptoms of depression is lack of concentration), I'm no longer constantly fatigued, I'm eating normally again. However, I find I'm going into tangential thoughts a lot too, which is something that happens a lot to me when I'm in what we think might be hypomanic episodes. I'm more outgoing, wanna talk more with my friends. Possibly have had some racing thoughts but not for long enough or not severe enough to actually affect my ability to do homework. \n\nSo... is it too early for it to be the Wellbutrin kicking in? Does this sound to you like the kinds of effects you'd expect from the Wellbutrin? I'm certainly not complaining about my current state, I quite like it and it's been good so far. I'm just curious about whether it's one of those things that wears off later on (like the first few days' 'high' I mentioned) or if it's more likely to be hypomania. Regardless, I'm going to discuss all of this with my psychiatrist in my appointment tomorrow, and she'll tell me for sure. I'm just curious to hear what y'all have to say.

She has asked me to watch out for any manic symptoms though and to please write down and keep track of my moods so we can see what my reaction is to the Wellbutrin.\n\nI was wondering if you guys have any recommendations on an app I could download or a scale to make copies of so I can keep a chart. If it's an app, preferably one with reminders. Also, what sort of things should I write down? I already have the daylio app installed and I have been using it for about 3 months now, but I'd like something more detailed than that.

I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/49YxKylNDEI) out of mere curiosity and something she said resonated with me and made the pieces fall into place, so I finally understand Catholic sexual ethics:\n\nThough I have never struggled with the \"no sex outside marriage\" rule, and indeed, I strongly believe in it, I had never realized the sheer meaning of it. After all that she says in the video, I understood the incoherence behind current American culture's view of sex.\n\nYou cannot say casual sex is okay and at the same time say homosexual sex is okay: \n\n* If casual sex is okay, you're denying that sex has a unitive purpose. (If you can have sex with just anyone, it means that no important bond is being established between you and that other person- no union. It's just physical activity, like exercise.) This is wrong, however. The unitive aspect of sex has been demonstrated to exist from a scientific perspective, in part due to the release of oxytocin. You're also denying the procreative aspect of sex, which is obvious- otherwise, there would be no need for birth control or contraceptives in these situations.\n\n* However, the very reason many people try to argue in favor of homosexual sex being okay is its unitive aspect. (\"If two people love each other, they can demonstrate,that love via sex.\")\n\n* So then sex is and isn't unitive at the same time? Impossible, and logically incoherent.\n\nThus, it is clear that sex should be only within the context of a stable, unbreakable relationship- in particular, marriage. To say one should be allowed to form such a deep bond with more than one person is to promote something more like polygamy, which I believe is problematic.\n\nBut then one must ask what marriage is. If it were simply a way to show you really love someone and are promising to be loyal to them for all your life, you wouldn't need to marry; it wouldn't change anything. But clearly, people have an idea that being married is fundamentally different from just dating, so... what is it, then?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that marrying means starting a family (or at least, being open to that). People who marry have legal and social benefits specifically helpful when it comes to raising children. They are recognized as being in a stable relationship and are able to support each other financially and emotionally. The state allows them certain benefits so that they are able to devote the time and energy required to raising their children. Marriage, essentially, is meaningless if we ignore the family aspect of it. If two people are married but are completely against the idea of having children, then how is it any different from dating (putting financial benefits aside)? \n\n* So if sex should only exist within marriage, and marriage means starting a family, then it follows that you cannot divorce sex from its procreative aspect either.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Catholicism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi4f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wisdom and Sexual Ethics", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/7geke4/wisdom_and_sexual_ethics/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "aliendividedbyzero", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1511104609, "domain": "self.AskReddit", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7e153k/if_you_disagreed_when_your_therapist_said_youre/", "id": "7e153k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7e153k/if_you_disagreed_when_your_therapist_said_youre/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1511182271, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "If you disagreed when your therapist said you're fine/just stressed, were you correct?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7e153k/if_you_disagreed_when_your_therapist_said_youre/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "aliendividedbyzero", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "Roman Catholic", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510411606, "domain": "self.AskAChristian", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAChristian/comments/7c8qmr/protestants_how_did_you_choose_which_church_to_go/", "id": "7c8qmr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/AskAChristian/comments/7c8qmr/protestants_how_did_you_choose_which_church_to_go/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1510503315, "score": 5, "selftext": "I am Catholic, and I wish to understand you better.

Most are only just culturally so. While being Catholic is certainly not a requirement for me in terms of what I'd like in a partner, it helps very much because I want someone who shares important values with me. For example, I want someone who understands that I wish to keep chastity and that I love going to Mass because Jesus is truly present in the Eucharist. I want someone who will not only encourage me not to sin, but also understands what things are and aren't sinful as God has taught us, rather than deciding for himself if that makes sense?\n\nBut the culture around me is very much one of sexual promiscuity and indifference. It is very much one of being Catholic in name only and believing much more as a Protestant or an atheist than as a Catholic would, without even giving faithful assent wherever they've yet not come to understand why the Church teaches what she does.

(It can't, but for the sake of my question, I must grant the supposition that it can.) Would that be enough for you, as an atheist, to believe that that god exists?\n\nThis is kind of a complicated question to phrase properly, so if I've been unclear, please let me know. Anyway, to expand on my question so as to illustrate what I mean:\n\nI've often seen atheists reject a person's supernatural experiences based on \"it was just a dream\" or \"it was just a hallucination\" or something along those lines. However, that merely is making note of the mechanism via which the person experienced whatever they did or did not experience. \n\nSo for example: a dream is real while you are dreaming and it's only falsified later, when you compare it to the reality you experience when you are awake. However, elements from that reality can seep into the dream, and since you're not in both realities simultaneously, you can't draw the line between what exists exclusively as a product of the dream itself, and what exists as a product of external stimuli. \n\nAnother example: If a person hallucinates, what they hallucinate is real while they're experiencing it. They may falsify it later, once they're no longer hallucinating and are able to corroborate with non-hallucinatory reality. Furthermore, this non-hallucinatory reality may contribute material to the hallucination, and since the person doesn't know they're hallucinating (for this example, because I know self-awareness is possible), they can't draw the line either- much like the person dreaming.\n\nSo then, science can describe the mechanisms through which these things happen, or could reasonably be expected to describe them someday. Why does that explanation  affect the validity of the statement the person makes about what they perceived? Some things perceived in dreams or hallucinations are easily falsified (for example: I can corroborate that the mountain near my house is not a volcano, and I can corroborate that there are no bugs all over the wall) because they pertain to things we can verify through science. But there are often elements of truth in dreams (for example: I dreamed someone was shaking me to get my attention, but really, it was a mild earthquake that happened while I slept), and there may be elements of truth in hallucinations. Supposing a supernatural world exists, we could say that if there are elements of truth and non-truth of the natural world in experiences like dreams and hallucinations, then the same may be the case for the supernatural elements in these experiences. Problem is that science can't verify hem because science deals with the natural world only. But to say that 100% of the supernatural claims coming from such experiences are not true seems dishonest to me because, while maybe they're experienced in a bit of a warped sort of manner, they may have explanations in the same way that the natural reality's truths found in such experiences are warped but have explanations too.\n\nBut more generally: an argument I've heard atheists use against the existence of any god at all is the \"god of the gaps\" argument, where the atheist states that god is merely there to explain what science hasn't yet been able to. For example, the theist says \"the universe was created by a god\" and the atheist replies \"actually, science says the universe was created by the Big Bang.\" But... how does us knowing the mechanism through which the universe came into existence (Big Bang) make the statement that \"a god created [it]\" false? Said god could very well have chosen to make it via causing the Big Bang to happen. In another, similar thought: atheists say that Abraham hearing God's voice was a hallucination. That's simply an explanation of the mechanism through which he may have heard it. It doesn't make God's existence impossible: God could have chosen to speak to him in that specific way. \n\nSo then:\n\nMany atheists claim if science could show evidence of the supernatural, they'd believe it. But my question is, honestly, would they really? Or would they simply return to the \"we know how it happens, so it cannot really be a god\" statement? (Or maybe, if it could measure a god: \"we measured it, so it really isn't a god, it's something else.\"\n\nAgain, hopefully what I'm trying to say makes sense? \n\nEDIT: I'm not ignoring some of you. I do see your replies.

I've never seen debate over this in Spanish-speaking communities (at least, not based on that specific part of the Hail Mary prayer), and that's because in Spanish, \"hail Mary\" is \"Dios te salve, Mar\u00eda\" (\"God save you, Mary,\" but it kind of means something more like \"God bless you\" or \"God keep you\"). I guess that even without being consciously aware of it, the fact that I learned it in Spanish first (I'm bilingual, English is my second language) made me aware of the fact that the prayer starts with a greeting, even though I didn't know that \"hail\" used to be a greeting in English.\n\nSimilarly, *because* I am bilingual and know from personal experience just how delicate the task of translating something is, I see great value in owning multiple translations of the same text- namely, the Bible. Different people translate the same exact sentence in slightly different ways, and being able to see these subtle differences can give you an idea of what the original language's way of phrasing it actually meant to say. Often, too, I notice that this actually resolves doubts I have when particular verses are presented to me as if though they're problematic for Christianity as a whole. Just because a specific word was chosen in English doesn't mean it fully conveys the meaning of the original word it stands for (and even saying this is inaccurate, as it may represent the partial meaning of a word or the meaning of multiple words due to how grammar differs). It only means that the author thought it was the best way to convey that meaning, given how language was used at the time of the translation being composed. It's very much an artistic, stylistic choice as much as it is a concrete thing. Reading different translations of the same text can, in a sense, help you look past the language itself and dwell in the more abstract thought being communicated.\n\nIn short, I guess what I'm saying is: an understanding of how language works (semantically, mechanically, culturally, and historically) is a very powerful tool when it comes to understanding and explaining the faith. I realized I find myself in a privileged position, in this respect, and that other people's lack of awareness about these subtleties of language leads to serious misunderstanding and unfounded arguments.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Catholicism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi4f", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A little thought about language and translation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/6uwn09/a_little_thought_about_language_and_translation/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "aliendividedbyzero", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503173451, "domain": "self.askapsychologist", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askapsychologist/comments/6ura8m/odd_reaction_grief/", "id": "6ura8m", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/askapsychologist/comments/6ura8m/odd_reaction_grief/", "retrieved_on": 1503268089, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey!

I am aware that the church states that being a homosexual is not a sin, it is only acting on that inclination that is a sin. I am also aware that the church calls for love and respect to homosexual persons, just as it would with any other, i.e. we are all sinners and should not discriminate, but rather show love to others. I must admit that, try as I have and keep doing, I still don't understand why homosexual acts are immoral. It seems that the condemnations in the Bible refer to pedophilia and ritual sex, which of course, I am against both of those things. But nowhere does it seem to speak about homosexual relationships like we understand them to be today. I understand that the argument then is Natural Law, but that's one of the things refuted in the paper that I'd like a better explanation for. I don't want to go against the Church because I do believe it to be the one, true Church, but I am really struggling to understand this particular teaching.\n\n\n1. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wPiLCk3zM-z7PbJvxSZQSIMi8_ZivXqmfVfnV-YfirI/pub\n\n2. http://aplus.com/a/-student-catholic-high-school-homophobic-homework-assignment-gay-marriage?no_monetization=true&utm_content=inf_10_459_2&utm_campaign=i2984&tse_id=INF_3f46c4103cbc11e785b761b07d40d40a", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Roman_Catholics", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ag72", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Help me understand the Church's position / how to refute this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Roman_Catholics/comments/6dbvkq/help_me_understand_the_churchs_position_how_to/", "view_count": null}, {"author": "aliendividedbyzero", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1495658091, "domain": "self.Coffee", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/6d4tvu/question_reactions_to_caffeine/", "id": "6d4tvu", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Coffee/comments/6d4tvu/question_reactions_to_caffeine/", "retrieved_on": 1497175854, "score": 18, "selftext": "I don't normally drink coffee- only when I absolutely need the energy boost to do my schoolwork on time.

So I'm a Catholic myself and I am a writer. I mostly hang around forums doing roleplaying (for those who don't know, in this sense it refers to collaborative writing. In other words, I write some stuff from my character's point of view or as my character and then the other person replies to that from their character's POV or as their character). Now, there's a wide variety of characters on there and I've noticed some characters who are Catholic but the writers aren't. Because of this, they miss out on important aspects of our religion or misunderstand other things. I tried searching to see if there was a writing guide I could share with these people so that they'd learn more and write more accurate characters within the framework of what their characters are (I understand there's a wide variety of adherence to the religion, as I've witnessed it myself) but found no such guide.\n\nI decided to remedy this by writing my own. I'm a little lost in terms of where to begin, though. I thought it'd be a matter of explaining differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, as it seems people interpret the term Catholic to mean Protestant Christians but with more emphasis on Mary or on ritual stuff or something, when really... that misses out on a LOT of subtlety. Then I realized, to explain the differences, I'd have to explain what the Church even is, and I realize now that what I had hoped would be a single post will probably be multiple post discussing all sorts of things- from church history to its beliefs to the difference between cultural Catholics and traditionalist Catholics, for example.\n\nSo... before I jump into this titanic endeavor, any of you have any suggestions at all on what sort of things I should address in particular, or even, any clue how to start at all? I'm almost sure I'm going to just write a really long essay as a Word document and section it off by parts to later turn into post format.

Because they also found no direct cause to my problems, they said I'm fine and there's nothing they can do to help. (Note: My therapist has a supervisor because I went to a university's community clinic, so she's a student and her supervisor is a licensed psychologist and her professor.)\n\nHowever... I think they're wrong about this. I understand if they can't make a specific diagnosis, but I disagree with them saying there's nothing wrong. I've been experiencing symptoms of what I *think* might be bipolar disorder (it's just unclear to me whether I've experienced hypomania or not because, while it seems to me like it's out of the ordinary behavior for me specifically, it's not something others have particularly noticed or that has seriously impaired me- only somewhat) and at least the periods of depression have gotten bad enough that I can't function in my day to day life.\n\nI went to this therapist for a total of 3 visits, and had originally scheduled because I spent about 3 weeks (maybe a bit more, time became a blur) in depression bad enough that I am now failing most of my classes, when I am normally a straight-A student. Granted, I understand if my grades drop a little because I'm in university now and engineering... is not an easy major. But to go from mostly As to mostly Ds or Fs is not right, particularly given the reason for it. Even my parents and my friends were worried something was wrong.\nUnfortunatly, my mood totally flipped 3-4 days before my appointment so that when I actually went to speak with the therapist for the first time, I felt 'normal'. This later escalated into what I think was a hypomanic period but I can't say for sure because I'm not a doctor. Now I'm back to normal, I think, but I'm without a mental health practitioner and I don't know what to do.\n\nMy parents think I'm just lazy and unfocused or that I dislike my major and that's why I'm failing, but that's not the case. My therapist said I'm fine and dismissed my symptoms despite me specifically explaining that I couldn't deal with this on my own anymore and that it was affecting my life negatively in ways I find unacceptable. I'm afraid that because I'm now fine (and, honestly, I don't know how long this will last... it's not the first time the mood swings have happened) I will be dismissed by yet another doctor. I don't know if to wait for symptoms to show up again so I can go see someone different this time and they'll believe me, or if I should go now even though I'm not currently showing any symptoms as far as I'm aware.
