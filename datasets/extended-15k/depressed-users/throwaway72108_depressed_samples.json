This is probably a pretty unpopular opinion here but I don\u2019t know man, I don\u2019t really care about animals and I thought I\u2019d check if someone else was like me. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that so many species are going extinct but I don\u2019t really care about it further than that. The reason why I\u2019m a vegetarian is because I think the biggest problems humanity are facing are all related to our environment. \n\nI know that I\u2019m very inconsistent with my compassion for animals. I dislike dogs and don\u2019t really care for them, but I love cats. I don\u2019t care for cows but I feel sorry for chickens. The first meat I stopped eating was chicken, it\u2019s easy to see that chicken has in fact been an animal so I think that\u2019s how that started. Meatballs / steak etc: you know it\u2019s meat, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s an animal if you understand what I mean? Like I said, I know I\u2019m inconsistent, I can only speculate as to why I feel this way. I kept eating beef for many more years until I learned more about the environmental impacts it has and I\u2019ve been vegetarian for almost 1 year now. \n\nI think one of the big reasons why I don\u2019t care about cows is because I think we\u2019ve effectively created them. If everyone stopped eating beef / using products made from cows today, realistically speaking every single cow would die. They won\u2019t make it in the wilderness. They\u2019d probably survive as a zoo attraction or something down the line, but I don\u2019t see them staying at the insane numbers they have right now. For me, I really couldn\u2019t care less if they went extinct. Those who want to stop consuming everything from cows, I wonder if they realize that 50 years from now cows would most likely be extinct if everyone stopped using cow related products. \n\nThis (combined with laziness) is why I\u2019m a vegetarian instead of a vegan. For the most part I don\u2019t really care about animals. I think it\u2019s utterly disgusting how we breed chickens. If they\u2019re not killed for their meat then they die within months either way as their organs can\u2019t keep up with their bodies. I think it\u2019s disgusting how humans are OK with that...but I don\u2019t really feel sorry for the chickens. The disgusting part is how we\u2019ve changed species so far beyond recognition. I feel sorry for their species, but I don\u2019t really have empathy for the individual chicken. \n\nIf I had to speculate, I think it could be because I\u2019ve never actually seen an animal die. I\u2019ve seen them in neat boxes at the supermarket, but I\u2019ve never actually seen them go through the process of dying. I think gore is really hard to watch so I\u2019ve never tried to see it. I might have more empathy for animals if I had to see it with my own eyes, I don\u2019t really know. The death of my first cat when I was a kid really affected me, which could be why I love cats more than any other animal.\n\nAm I completely alone in these mindsets?

Years of disbelief, years of uncertainty, years of agonizing pain followed. Everyone thought I was lying. The tumor was found when I was 14 which explained the pain. Years of chemo, months of radiation therapy, too many surgeries to count. My friends had their first drinks, got in their first relationships, lost their virginities. I had my first experience with agony, was introduced to death, lost my childhood and in many ways my chances of a happy life. \n\nTreatment left me broken and bruised. With scars all over my body and what I initially thought was a fortified mind, I thought I had been saved. I didn\u2019t know that the pain had only just begun. I\u2019ve experienced so many late side effects, I\u2019m not as clever as before, I can\u2019t think as fast. I couldn\u2019t run anymore, my foot was maimed. Each step more painful than the last, I was shattering bones by walking. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of misery in my life, but I\u2019ve tried to be happy. I surround myself with good people. I try to be a good person, I want to inspire and motivate people. If they knew how I really felt, they\u2019d look at me differently. I\u2019ve seen it in peoples eyes so many times: there\u2019s sorrow and pity, but for the most part they\u2019re simply relieved that they haven\u2019t had to see what I\u2019ve seen. I need to show them that I can be happy, because then their eyes light up. I love it when their eyes light up, I\u2019m reminded that happiness is possible. I need to show them that I can be happy after what I\u2019ve seen because then their problems pale in comparison. If I could overcome a mountain, then they can overcome their hills. \n\nI met a beautiful woman. I didn\u2019t have cancer for many years. We planned our future together. I didn\u2019t think I was allowed to be happy. Everything I\u2019ve ever loved, everything I\u2019ve ever been good at has been ruthlessly stolen from me. I was good at sports, my foot was destroyed. I was smart, my mind was distorted. I was happy, and turned into a cynic. But she loved me, and I loved her. Life was bearable again. \n\nLike a dagger through my heart, ice throughout my body. Forever frozen. Everything I touch turn to stone. Hearing her cry for me. Because of me. Without me, they wouldn\u2019t have to experience so much devastation. I have too many people that count on me. But her cry was the worst, my heart viciously destroyed, shattered into a million pieces. Because of me. My cancer returned and my leg was amputated. I\u2019ve seen so much pain and misery, nothing compares with the devastation in knowing that I\u2019m the reason that she cried. It was because of me. Next time it comes back, maybe I die? I broke up with her. I gave her some bullshit excuse. I love her more than I thought was possible. I miss her every day. I wish it didn\u2019t have to be like this. I\u2019d rather make her sad by breaking up with her than to start a life with her only to die before 30, leaving her behind.\n\nIt\u2019s been 13 years of pain, but nobody prepared me for this. I\u2019ve been close to death so many times, it still doesn\u2019t compare. I\u2019m 23 and I coped with dying 9 years ago. In many ways I wish I\u2019d died back then, the grief wouldn\u2019t have had to touch so many peoples lives if I\u2019d died back then. I\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019m putting everyone through. \n\nI don\u2019t know how coherent this is, english isn\u2019t my first language.

But now I find it increasingly hard to feel good.\n\nI\u2019m ruining relationships left and right, both romantic relationships and friendships. I struggle to trust people, I\u2019m a compulsive liar, sometimes I manipulate people without even realizing I\u2019m doing it. I don\u2019t know how to become a better person.\n\nThe damage to me happened mainly when I was younger. It started when I was 10 years old when an unexplainable pain started growing in my foot. I went and saw a crazy amount of doctors but none of them could find anything wrong with me. The pain got worse and I started telling my friends and teachers that I was in too much pain to go outside and play, but I was met with disbelief, as if I was too lazy to go out and just wanted to stay inside. The doctors had said I was perfectly fine, and so the idea that I\u2019d be in pain seemed very foreign to those around me. I was called a liar so many times. A couple years later I had to quit playing football as I was unable to run, which only made things worse. I was basically branded a liar by the entire football team. I suffered through ridicule and being called a liar, while being in constant, agonizing pain. In order to stop being called a liar, I became a liar. I started lying about the pain, I started hiding it to the best of my ability. I became very good at lying, and I realized that by not being honest, I could make my situation a lot better. And so I kept lying and got better at it each time I told a lie. Eventually I started lying about the most pointless things. I got so good at lying that I started to believe my own lies, was I really in pain? Had I been lying? Everyone else thought I was lying so maybe I was? Meanwhile the pain kept getting worse, but I couldn\u2019t understand it.\n\nA couple of months before my 15th birthday a tumor was located in my foot. Based on tissue samples and size it was estimated that it had been growing for 5 years. I was diagnosed with cancer. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve been close to death. I did a year of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation therapy and I\u2019ve gone through 15+ surgeries. I was done with all of the treatment when I was 17. My foot was basically broken. I was breaking bones from walking. After a while we stopped xraying it, nothing could be done about the bones and I\u2019d already been exposed to too much radiation.\n\nI was still good at lying. I did anything and everything to hide my disease, because what if people didn\u2019t believe me? I started drinking to numb the pain. I pretended for so many years that everything was fine. The cancer returned last year and my leg had to be amputated.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced chronic pain for 13 years now. My kidneys are close to failing. I\u2019m only 23 man. I\u2019ve spent so much time being afraid. Afraid of death, afraid of pain but mostly I\u2019m afraid of disbelief. I don\u2019t know how to open up to someone. I don\u2019t know how to stop lying. I sometimes don\u2019t even realize when I\u2019m lying, the line between honesty and lies has been so incredibly blurred.

I got the initial diagnosis when I was 14, I had symtoms since I was 10. The first symtom was pain, the tumor was located in my foot. Each step hurt worse than the last. My cancer is very hard to detect, and grows very slowly until it becomes aggressive. The aggressiveness is triggered by bones breaking or something like that near the tumor. I\u2019ve done almost 20 surgeries and a couple years of treatment. Chemo, radiation therapy. When the cancer returned my leg had to be amputated (luckily no other treatment).\n\nInitially we didn\u2019t really know my chances. As my cancer is hard to detect, it was virtually impossible to know whether it has spread or not. That\u2019s probably why I had to do so much chemo and radiation therapy, but it feels like it happened a lifetime ago and I was only a kid so I don\u2019t remember it all that well. The parts I remembered I\u2019ve long since repressed. It took 4-5 years for the first tumor to be found, it took 7 years to find the new tumors, there could be many tumors throughout my body right now; no way to know for sure.\n\nI have been close to dying so many times now. Blood infections, normal infections, blood transfusions not working properly, during surgeries, from the chemo, and more reasons. I\u2019ve been in pain for as long as I can remember. \n\nI\u2019ve experienced so much misery. I still find it difficult to walk, and I\u2019ve been unable to run for most of my life. My kidneys are shot. Most of the side-effects happened during chemo, the biggest late side-effect is PTSD. I was too young. My hair and my teeth still haven\u2019t recovered. I\u2019ve got chemo-brain and my mind has become terrible, I can\u2019t remember things I most definitely should remember, and I can\u2019t focus good at all. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned from this whole cancer thing is that your state of mind does matter. I\u2019m not one of those hocus-pocus faith healing believers that\u2019s going to try and tell you that positivity = being cured, but I firmly believe that positivity = a better life. \n\nI came to grips with the fact that I may not turn 15, and then 16, and then 17 etc. I came to grips with all that I lost, all of my hopes and dreams that were ruined, but that doesn\u2019t mean I forgot to be positive. I came to grips with what I was dealing with, I acknowledged the problems, and then I put them to the side and made the most of what I had. It doesn\u2019t matter if we have 100 years, 10 years, 1 year or 1 day left. We will all die eventually, the only thing that matters is what we do with whatever time we have left. \n\nNow, like I mentioned with the hocus-pocus faith healing, my positivity isn\u2019t the reason why I\u2019m still here today. My doctors, modern medicine and pure dumb luck is why I survived. But my positivity is most definitely why I\u2019ve been able to enjoy life, through the surgeries, through the treatments, through the side-effects, and through the pain. Life is the only thing we really have, and I didn\u2019t want to waste the only chance I\u2019ll ever get at it.\n\nI was at a party two days ago, I went there with my best friend. There were pretty much only people from his college there so I didn\u2019t know anyone at all. I wore jeans that revealed my ankles, so pretty much everyone saw that I had an amputated leg. Usually people don\u2019t really know what to say/do, so at first it\u2019s usually just an avoided subject. At 11pm my friend was passed out drunk (lightweight), and so I was pretty much alone. I proceeded to party with these people I had only just met. A drinking game was being played. The game is that a statement is made and people point their fingers to whoever they think the statement is the most true for, and you drink as many sips as there are fingers pointing at you. A statement was \u201dwho has the smelliest feet\u201d; to which I loudly and proudly proclaimed that \u201dIt sure as hell can\u2019t be me, I\u2019ve got 50% less feet than all of you\u201d, to which pretty much the entire room burst out laughing. My point with this story is that cancer, and pretty much all problems, don\u2019t have to be sad. This horrible disease that has stolen so much from me doesn\u2019t have to be what defines me. People will automatically put other people in boxes, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s bad, that\u2019s just how it is. Cancer / other diseases / amputees will usually be put in the \u201dsad/pity\u201d box, but it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. You can make it alright, and you can even make it funny. You can choose to make the most out of it. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is any help to any of you, or if it just seems like ramblings. Either way, I hope everyone\u2019s doing as good as possible. No matter what you\u2019re going through right now, I wish you nothing but the best. Life with cancer doesn\u2019t have to be a constant stream of sadness and anger, there\u2019s a little bit of beauty in everything around us. Cancer has made what\u2019s important a lot more obvious to me, and through it I\u2019ve realized that even the briefest of moments can be filled with beauty. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time and energy being angry at the world, it took me many years before I reached this mindset, I only wish I\u2019d figured it out sooner. Everything in life isn\u2019t beautiful, but a lot of it can be if you just want it to be.

I don\u2019t really know what to do. The situation I\u2019ve found myself in is completely ridiculous. For many years it\u2019s been getting worse each day. I\u2019ve been sad a lot, but for the most part I\u2019m just so incredibly angry. There\u2019s no end to the sadness, the heartbreak, the pain and the anger. I never get to breathe, it always keeps accelerating. I\u2019m angry with what I\u2019ve had to go through, I\u2019m angry with myself and I\u2019m angry with the world.\n\nThe main feeling I\u2019ve experienced in my life is pain. There\u2019s been so much of it. I feel very numb because of it, physically aswell as mentally. The pain has been eating away at me with no mercy. Lately I\u2019ve been getting fed up with it and honestly I have no idea what to do to get past it.\n\nThe pain started when I was very young, I hadn\u2019t even turned 10 yet. It started in my foot. It grew constant within a couple of years. I\u2019ve spent more than half of my life in agonizing pain, I can\u2019t even remember a moment in which I wasn\u2019t in pain. \n\nI slowly started to lose myself. I was a very active kid, but the pain wouldn\u2019t allow me to stay that way. I lost the ability to run, even walking became struggle. After school and work I\u2019d only sleep, I\u2019m always tired because the pain completely drains me of all my energy.\n\nI saw so many doctors. They didn\u2019t have an explanation for me until I was 14, when the tumor was found. It had been growing inside my right foot for more than 5 years. It turned out to be cancer. I went through chemo, radiation therapy and multiple surgeries, and at age 16 I was a cancer survivor. I was completely cured, the problem was that I was worse off because of it.\n\nMy problems and the pain intensified due to the extreme treatment I went through. My hair barely grows anymore. Most of my organs are permanentally damaged. My right leg was 5 inches shorter than my left leg. My right foot was 3 shoe sizes smaller than my left foot. My right foot was as stiff as a brick, I haven\u2019t been able to move my toes at all since before the treatment. I was in a wheel chair for about a year, and then I had to learn how to walk again. It felt as if I was breaking bones just from walking, it turned out that I was. After about a year of constantly going to the doctor to see if yet another bone was broken there just wasn\u2019t any point in getting more xrays. I\u2019d already been exposed to so much radiation that the xrays were doing more harm than good. Nothing could be done about the broken bones either way, so I stopped getting xrays and I continued shattering bones in my foot.\n\nThroughout my life I\u2019ve had to endure excruciating pain. It never stops. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve had to go through this. I was robbed of my childhood and I was stripped of any chances of a normal life. I try to cope with the situation, but it\u2019s hard. The pain doesn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s just getting worse.\n\nI worked at my last job for almost 3 years. The pay was alright, but I was working myself to death. During the weekends all I did was get drunk so that I could make the pain go away. During the weekdays all I did was work, I didn\u2019t have any strength left in my body after work so all I did was sleep. Most of the time I slept for 13-14 hours, the longest I\u2019ve slept is 18 hours. I didn\u2019t have a full time job, I didn\u2019t have a week to week schedule at all, I only worked when I was called in to work. I was pretty solid at what I did so they needed me pretty often, I worked 5/6 days every week, so despite not having a permanent position I was working full time hours. When my cancer came back last year I was let go from work. As my position wasn\u2019t permanent they had no obligations to keep me around. My leg had to be amputated.\n\nI\u2019ve been lucky in that I\u2019ve had some girlfriends, I have no idea what they saw in me though. I guess that could be why it didn\u2019t work out with any of them, I\u2019m probably very depressing to be around. I can\u2019t really show any emotions, I haven\u2019t cried since I was 15. When I was 14 and I got the news that I had cancer, it was me, my mom and the doctor in the room. I had to watch as my mom cried, I comforted her. It hurt like hell to watch her like that. In that moment I swore to never again be the cause of her sadness. I had a girl when my cancer came back, hearing her cry like she did is the worst thing I\u2019ve gone through in my entire life. I had to break up with her. My life isn\u2019t normal, and around every corner there\u2019s a new heartbreak. I didn\u2019t think it was fair to put her through it all. I still love her, and I still miss her. It took my cancer 7 years to return. What if I start a life with her. I could be 30 when the cancer returns and claims my life, it\u2019s not fair to force her to see that. Fuck man. \n\nI\u2019m 23 years old with a high school degree. I haven\u2019t gone to university / college because I\u2019ve got problems focusing because of my chemo-brain. I was let go because of cancer, but even if I had kept the job I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it because I\u2019m down a leg. I don\u2019t have a job, I\u2019m always in pain, I can\u2019t focus and I have absolutely no idea what I\u2019m going to do. I don\u2019t know why I have to go through this, I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why it has to be so hard. I don\u2019t care about being rich / poor. I don\u2019t care about having few / many friends. I don\u2019t care about liking / disliking a job. I don\u2019t really care about anything. I just don\u2019t want to be in pain anymore. I wish I never had cancer. I want to have a normal life. I miss sports so fucking much. Why does it have to be like this.\n\nI can\u2019t run. My kidneys are close to failing. The phantom limb pains are very intense, which means loads of pills. Loads of pills mean no alcohol, and no alcohol means I can\u2019t make myself numb. I\u2019ve been close to death more times than I can count. I struggle with feeling unattractive. I\u2019m unable to have kids. I feel disconnected from the world, like nobody understand me. I\u2019ve lost a leg. I\u2019m always, always in pain. Every single problem I have in life came out of cancer. Some probelms didn\u2019t come directly out of cancer, but they\u2019re all side-effects of it. Cancer has shaped me into the person that I am today. I\u2019m not suicidal, I wouldn\u2019t put my family through something like that. My family and my friends are the only reason why I\u2019m still here, I would\u2019ve offed myself many years ago if it weren\u2019t for them. I wish that the cancer had killed me instead. I hate myself and I hate my life, and there\u2019s nothing I can do to fix it.

I was weened off it and I thought I was doing alright. \n\nI didn\u2019t do Oxy for many years, instead I searched for other ways to get closer to that feeling. Weed, cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, anything and everything to try and get there. The pain never stopped, the tumor had been in my foot so I was even worse off after treatment. It was always pain. After a couple years I was put on citodone, which I took plenty of. It never helped with the pain, and I couldn\u2019t really get any sensations from it, so I just quit after a while.\n\nI think my main addiction has been Oxy, despite of the fact that I\u2019ve mainly been getting drunk. Oxy is harder to get. Atleast, that\u2019s until last year. My cancer returned and my leg was amputated. An endless stream of Oxy followed. It\u2019s been half a year since the amputation, I\u2019m still very much hooked on it. I also take an anti-depressant and gabapentin, both to deal with the phantom limb pains. I\u2019ve been trying to get off Oxy but I\u2019m struggling with the withdrawals. It feels like the craziest flu. Can\u2019t sleep at night, despite being so incredibly tired. When I do get to sleep I always have constant nightmares, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got PTSD from being so young with cancer, although the nightmares and the PTSD is like that when I\u2019m on Oxy aswell so I guess that\u2019s besides the point. \n\nI don\u2019t know man. I need to get off Oxy and get back into my life. The withdrawals are killing me, I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll do more. How do you stay off it when it feels like it\u2019s the only way for you to rest? How do you stay off it when it\u2019s the only happy place you have, as the rest of your life\u2019s a horrible mess? I don\u2019t know. In many ways it feels like Oxy has been my only friend through this. It lets me get away for a few. When I\u2019m sober I don\u2019t really have any feelings. I don\u2019t feel sad, I don\u2019t feel depressed, I just don\u2019t really feel anything. It\u2019s like I\u2019m numb. Like now, it doesn\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m talking about myself. These things don\u2019t even seem like reality. It feels like I\u2019m describing somebody else. With Oxy I can be happy/sad/angry and even feel love. It\u2019s hard.

My family would stay with me. I\u2019ve always had them. I still found happiness, because my mindset has always been \u201dit\u2019s better me, than anyone of them\u201d. \n\nWhen the radiation therapy started, when the surgeries became too many to count, I was still happy. \n\nWhen I spent months in a wheelchair, when I\u2019d lost 50% of my weight, I was still happy. \n\nWhen I was 16 and had finished treatment, when the pain still hadn\u2019t left, I was happy. \n\nWhen I was 18 and as recovered as I\u2019d be able to get, when I realized I\u2019d never be able to run or play sports again...I cried. But the next day I found happiness once more.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to see my friends go through this horrible disease. I didn\u2019t have to see my family go through it either. I was the one that for some reason was chosen, and for this I was always happy.\n\nWhen one of my distant relatives was diagnosed, I was still happy.\n\nWhen one of my closest friends sister was diagnosed, I was still happy.\n\nWhen one of my closest friends mother was diagnosed, I was still happy.\n\nI had survived, and I thought that they could aswell. When I was 20 and I\u2019d spent half my life in pain. One after the other, they all died. When the pain of dealing with their loss was infinitely worse than the physical pain I\u2019d experienced...but I somehow still found happiness.\n\nI turned to alcohol and drugs to cloud the pain, I was somehow happy again.\n\nMy friends and family pulled me through, I was somehow happy again. \n\nThe loss wouldn\u2019t be forgotten, but I was somehow happy again. \n\nThe physical pain, the mental strain. I don\u2019t know how; but I found happiness. \n\nWhen I met the girl of my dreams, I was happy. \n\nWhen I got a good job, I was happy.\n\nWhen I wanted to go back to school and had figured out what I wanted to study, I was happy.\n\nThe pain was always there, the memories would never be forgotten, but my life had to continue and I had found happiness.\n\nI had to watch as my friends and family dealt with losing their loved ones. It was the hardest thing I\u2019d done in my life, despite not really knowing the other people battling cancer. I had a hard time dealing with it, but after everything I was still happy.\n\nWhen the cancer returned, and I broke up with my girl to prevent her from watching me deteriorate, I was hurt but still happy.\n\nWhen my mother and father couldn\u2019t hold back their tears, I was hurt but still happy.\n\nWhen my leg was amputated to prevent the cancer from spreading, I was hurt but still happy. \n\nIt still wasn\u2019t my friends, it still wasn\u2019t my family. They didn\u2019t have to die. I was happy to be the chosen one once more, because I was sure that they wouldn\u2019t die. \n\nWhen I figured out how to walk again, I was happy.\n\nWhen the pain was disappearing, I was happy. \n\nWhen the phantom limb pains grew less frequent, I was happy.\n\nWhen I figured out I was able to run again, something I hadn\u2019t done for 13 long years, I found happiness like I\u2019d never experienced it  before. \n\nMy story was over. It had finally come to an end. I run, I walk, I know what I want to do in the future. I\u2019ve had happiness along the way, but nothing like this. For the first time in 13 years, it was over, and my life could return to normal. \n\nBut when my best friend got diagnosed. There was nothing but pain and sadness.\n\nWhen the cancer was in his lounges, in his throat, in his groin and surrounding his spine. There was nothing but pain and sadness.\n\nHe\u2019s growing weak and frail, like I did. He\u2019s still got hope but I can see it slipping away from him. His diagnosis is more similar to those who die than to those who survive, and there is NOTHING but pain and sadness. \n\nHe\u2019s done with the first cycles of chemo, he\u2019s already done so many surgeries. If I lose him, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll survive the heartbreak. I don\u2019t know why my life has to look like this. Why my entire life has to be surrounded by this disease. When it was me, I could be happy. I\u2019d go through my treatment, and I\u2019d die for my friend thousands of times, if that meant that he wouldn\u2019t have to do this. I can\u2019t take it anymore. There is no way out. I was too young to go through pain. I was too young to go through cancer. I was too young to watch all of them go. He\u2019s too young to get cancer. We\u2019re all too young. Fuck this horrible, horrible disease. There will never be happiness again, there\u2019s only sadness.
