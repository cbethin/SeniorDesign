For instance, here the author is talking about the link between parent and child:\n\n*Whereas empathic attunement results in a state of joy and excitement, misattunement results in a drastic diminution of joy and excitement. Interest, enjoyment, exploration, activity, and eye contact stop. These misattunement events create an experience of the mother as a stranger and the infant as deficient. These experiences of misattunement may be understood as shame experiences. Shame experiences result from the sudden awareness that one is being viewed differently than one anticipated. In a shame experience, there is a split in awareness. The self is simultaneously experienced as deficient, helpless, confused, exposed, and passive, and at the same time is experiencing the shaming other as if inside the self. The other is experienced as powerful, overwhelming, judging, and right. Unrepaired shame experiences result in a self defined in shame. The shame self leads to a preoccupation with the feelings, behavior, and concerns of the other. This is a \u201cfalse\u201d self that experiences disorganization and an inability to regulate itself.\n(...)\nThe state of shame (i.e., of ruptured integrity), resulting from experiences of misattunement that are overwhelming and unrepaired, can be understood as the origin of learned patterns of interpersonal connections based on fear\u2014fear of losing the other, fear of losing the love or approval of the other, fear of being unlovable, fear of punishment by the other, and fear of not living up to one's ideal for one's self. These misattunement states may be lived out in a counterphobic manner wherein the importance of relatedness is denied. These patterns, when internalized, can result in a kind of social blindness that emerges from the person's desperate seeking for selfobject functions in adult relationships. Impetuousness, in fact, undermines the access of true self intelligence required to judge social situations reasonably clearly. The person living in a state of ruptured self is preoccupied with feelings defined in shame. The self is simultaneously concerned with its own emotional pain and lack of adequacy, and overwhelmed with concern about the other as one who controls the self experience and well-being.*\n\nDoes this ring a bell for you guys?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "subreddit_subscribers": 125519, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The link between shame and social anxiety", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/9qziio/the_link_between_shame_and_social_anxiety/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Renardt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1094mmmz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539627716, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ofa51/is_this_what_depression_feels_like/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9ofa51", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9ofa51/is_this_what_depression_feels_like/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539627717, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've been diagnosed with dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder), with bouts of depressive episodes apparently.

There's apparently a psychologist shortage, after a long wait I just ended up with whichever random person was available. At the start she admitted she never had any experience treating someone with social phobia or AvPD like me.\n\nI feel like she's fairly competent on a technical level. However she jumped straight into challenging me, not caring or not understand what the impact of what she says has on me, not caring about earning my trust either. I try to be \"better\" and not let it affect me, but it does. I talked about my life story, my difficult childhood, how my father abandoned me, how my mother was completely absent on an emotional level, never cared how I felt, was never involved in my life, didn't care that I was sad and things were going badly at school. My mother wasn't close to the rest of our family, I was isolated, stuck alone at home, and had no support. There was no play, no attention, no scheduled activities outside the house, nothing. In retrospect I feel like my mother has a limited capacity for empathy. I feel like people don't understand what it's like to grow up and not have a single person in the world that cares about you, that's there for you. Your perspective is completely invalidated, your feelings don't matter, you don't have any self-worth. I developed a deep sense of shame, that I was a fatally flawed person, a kind of defective, inferior human that was treated badly because I didn't deserve love. I didn't fight back when the bullies hit me at school; I thought I deserved it. I had trouble making friends because I thought nobody would like me.\n\nThe other day I come in for a therapy appointment and at some point in the conversation she mentions she wants to send to me to a neuropsychologist and get testing. I ask her why, and she says that because my grandmother was mentally ill, I might have inherited something. I ask what \"something\" is and she says it could be anything, she doesn't know. She says it was possible my issues were purely developmental, but that they could also be purely biological. I didn't let it show but that really upset me. I've always felt I'm responsible for everything bad that happened to me. My family always acted as though it was perfectly normal to neglect me. With the help of therapists in the past, I've been fighting with myself to convince myself that I deserved better, that I deserved people that took care of me, that it wasn't my fault that I was abandoned. I'm fine with the testing, I'm curious what the results would be and I'm quite confident the results would be normal or fairly normal. But the fact she's willing to overlook my entire history and take in consideration that a purely biological explanation is possible makes me very upset. Why am I telling this person my history? It clearly doesn't matter. She's invalidating me just like my family did. Even if the voice of my past therapists in still in my mind, I know they would disagree with her, it still hurts. Would she tell this to a \"child adult\" who had suffered physical abuse or sexual abuse? \"It might be because you're biologically flawed that you lived through this childhood badly.\" Why is it OK to invalidate people who suffer neglect?

Already at 6 years old I had some kind of inferiority complex. Starting getting bullied immediately after starting school. The older women monitoring the playground didn't believe me when I told them, they didn't seem to care either. My homeroom teacher was awful with me because I had bad grades. I had bad grades because I felt very distressed by the situation, but nobody cared to try understanding. One time she got very upset at me because she said I wasn't paying attention in class, she yelled at me and I starting crying. She forcefully gripped my hand and dragged me to a room next to the library, as I was crying, and locked me up there for the rest of the day to \"punish\" me. I cried for a long time. When the bell rang the end of the school day, she didn't even bother to help to me out, I had to bang on the door and get the attention of a library assistant to help me leave. By this point my father had abandoned me and I would never see him again, and my mother didn't give a flying shit what happened to me at school. The bullying continued and kids would push me around and go to the teachers and make up stories that I was doing something wrong, and I would get punished or fall under suspicion when I hadn't done a single thing wrong. It was like psychological warfare on top of the beatings.  I didn't have the self-confidence to stand up to myself, I felt like I had no value. The kids I could understand, but it really fucked me up that adults, the people supposedly looking out for you, were heartless monsters too. \n\nThis is basically what happened ages 6-7...

I look at what ordinary people do e.g. handling full time work, house chores, raising multiple children, and I don't know how they do it.\n- I wake up tired and sore. Taking a shower and getting dressed feels like a lot of effort for some reason. Seems weird considering everyone does it like it's nothing. It gets better as the day goes by though. \n- I don't really enjoy much. Sometimes I'll push myself to do something that's supposed to be fun and maybe I'll enjoy it a little. But when I weight it against the hassle and stress it causes me (I have social anxiety), it comes out to be more of a chore than fun. Do I want to prepare clothes, make sure I look good, do 1 hour of public transit feeling self-conscious, feel self-conscious doing the activity, feel a tiny bit of fun, then have to do 1 hour of public transit to go back home? Not really, it's just not worth it.\n- It's very difficult for me to laugh. I could watch 10 youtube compilations of \"try not to laugh\" and it would a miracle of any of them made me laugh. It's legitimately a mystery to me how people laugh to them.\n- I am sad a lot of the time. But I think it would be kind of insane not to be sad in my situation. I have no job, no friends, no partner. I'm working hard in therapy to get better. I feel like the stress and sadness I feel is very appropriate considering the situation.

I have a hard time being assertive around strangers, especially in a large group. I can't be myself in these situations. I didn't do as well as I could have even though I had a good strategy, really got me down. My therapist tells me to do these things so I can get better and more comfortable at talking with other people, but nobody was engaging in small talk at all, only making off-hand comments about the games, it made it hard to have an \"in\" into talking for me. I have trouble speaking loud enough sometimes which made it difficult because there were so many people talking and so much noise, I barely spoke the whole time.\n\nTowards the end we played a long game, but a player on the other team was repeatedly not following the rules and it messed up what I was doing. It didn't affect anyone else's role except mine so nobody cared. I was so done by this point I just impulsively told them I was done playing, say goodbye to the organizer, got my things and got out. I probably looked like a right idiot. I was there 5 hours. \n\nIt was really depressing seeing other people laughing and having a good time, participating fully, but I just couldn't do the same. I had to hold back tears on the way back home. I guess occasionally crashing and burning is part of the process. I guess that on the positive side it's really clear to me now that assertiveness and spontaneity is something I have to work on, specifically.

I've tried scheduling several appointments in advance but no dice, I think he's purposefully leaving space empty for his other clients, he doesn't want anyone to have a 2-week spacing because it would push other people into the 4-week wait range. I've told him I find this spacing difficult, he says all his other clients are waiting 3 weeks too. He says there's a shortage of psychologists in our area. He used to have space available every 2 weeks, so I think what's happening here is that he doesn't have the heart to turn away new clients so more people are being squeezed into the same schedule. I feel like it should be common sense that existing clients should be prioritized over the taking of new ones, especially when it's getting to this point where appointment time is stretched this thin.\n\n3 weeks is rough. My support network is basically non-existent. I think 3 weeks is a very tough waiting time for anyone with any serious issue. It's definitely impacting my therapy in a negative way. Recently he's told me out of the blue that it would be good if I took medication because he believes I may have dysthymia (persistent low-grade depression). Maybe I do, maybe I don't, I can't tell. I have a lot of tangible, real-world reasons for being sad, anyone in my situation would have to be literally insane to not be at least a little depressed. The mystery here is how I'm not more depressed than I am. I'm a little offended because I feel like he's checking out of his responsibilities. He's the one that created this painful 3-week waiting period... and he's pushing medication to deal with the fallout. I just want support, that's all I need, even 2-weeks spacing would make a world of difference.\n\nWhat do you guys think I should do, or say to him? I like him a lot, he's a good person, I don't want to offend him.
