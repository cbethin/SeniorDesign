I do not have Major Depression. I am not suicidal, really. I just am bored with life and tired and full of contempt for myself. I do things, I socialize, I can \"be\" happy, but I don't have much motivation. I have been unemployed for months. I occasionally say shit to my boyfriend on bad nights like \"what do I have to look forward to?\" \"What do I have in life to get out of bed for?\" \"My life is shitty and it's my fault and it's not gonna get much better.\"\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with dysthymia I felt that it was a misdiagnosis (because I never told the truth). I felt like I was much more severe, at least on the short-term. I think it was a major depressive episode at that time that lasted a couple of years. I was hurting myself frequently, I had thoughts of suicide daily, all I could think about was how much I hated myself and how worthless I was and it was debilitating. I was miserable all the time. Sometimes I physically couldn't move because  of how heavy it was. It was such an active, pervasive depression. \n\nSo when that passed, I thought I was doing better. I thought the meds fixed me. I thought that this constant low mood was better because it wasn't peppered with severe, intrusive thoughts, but it's really not better. I'm destroying my life more than I was then. I may have given myself permanent physical and mental scars at that time, but at least then my anxiety and self-hatred occasionally fueled me to accomplish things. Now I am so apathetic. I just don't care and I don't care that I don't care. I am broke, and lazy, and useless, and probably an alcoholic and I don't care. And occasionally (like now) I get depressed enough to realize how bad this is and how awfully I am doing but generally *I just don't care.*\n\nI guess I just didn't realize that dysthymia is not necessarily \"less\" severe, and I didn't realize that *I am still not okay.* I don't know why I'm posting this, I'm sorry. It's not really a cry for help; I'm fine. I'm not in danger.

She came to our house to drop the kid off, and asked him to go to the store with her to buy wine. He didn't tell me why he had to go to the store with her, didn't even tell me he was planning to leave the house until he was already out the door. When he finally texted me to say he was going to the store with her I asked about it but he wouldn't answer, I was starting to freak out so I looked on Facebook on his PC and saw what she had asked him to do. He finally responded to my question, and told me he was going to get cash for her for child support. I called him out on his bullshit and he got angry.\n\nHe claims he did it to maintain a positive relationship with his co-parent. He claims that he had to do it for leverage. He claims that I shouldn't be upset because it \"didn't negatively effect\" me for him to buy her alcohol. He gives me half-assed apologies for lying about it, but he doesn't think that there was a problem with what he actually did. \n\nI think that wine has literally nothing to do with their CHILD and it was way too personal and dangerous of a request given that it was coming from his ex-girlfriend, and he should've told her no, because the only part she should play in his life is that of a co-parentand anything he does for her should be for the sake of the kid.\n\nIs he right? Am I wrong to be pissed about this?\n\n*Tl;dr* he did what the title suggests and lied to me about it because she is his \"co-parent\" so he needs to maintain a line of positive communication with her. I think it was going way too far for her.

I've gotten three UTIs in the past 6-8 months. Wonder why.\n2. I leant him money for a car and he still owes me most of it (over a grand) and I'm still buying him food and helping him out with bills all the time because he won't keep a job, and now his (technically my) car isn't legal so he's using *mine,* and the gas I pay for, all the time.\n3. ...He won't keep a job.\n4. He has a kid. I don't want kids. At all, ever.\n5. He didn't do anything for me for Christmas, Valentine's day, our anniversary, or my birthday. Not even a note, a handmade gift, a home-cooked dinner, doing a load of my laundry... nothing. Even after I expressed that I wished he could be a little thoughtful and that I didn't need him to spend money, but that I'd appreciate ANY semblance of effort.\n6. Occasionally, he'll fall asleep while I'm having a panic attack and, the following morning, tell me it was because he was \"too drunk\" and \"exhausted\" and \"couldn't help it\".\n7. I've talked to him about every single issue on this list repeatedly and (barring #4) he apologized and then proceeded to repeat the behavior one or more times. His apologies are frequent, but now worthless.\n\n**Tl;dr:** my boyfriend is selfish as fuck but I can't make myself leave him.

I'm doing better! I held a job for nearly three years. I can go into stores by myself (and even buy things). I can force myself to add things, unprompted, to a conversation and occasionally initiate conversation when necessary. I have set up and gone to job interviews.\n\nI quit my job several months ago and I haven't been able to hold a job since. I'm not getting fired; I just keep quitting, or rather, I stop showing up. The first job lasted 2 months and I texted my boss to inform her I would not be returning. The second job lasted 3 days and I no-called/no-showed. I'm on job #3. I started yesterday. It is 3:39 AM and I don't think I can return to that job later today.\n\nThe jobs have been bearable.... I ended my shift today on good terms with my trainer and new coworker. I felt fine. The job was fine and the people were fine. Why can't I go back? Why am I still awake at almost 4am crying about how I can't keep a job and how I'm soon to be homeless because I'm broke?

Occasionally I will cuddle up to him when we're in bed but usually when he initiates cuddling I'll stay still or even move away. I don't even like kissing him all that often. I like talking to him and hanging out with him a lot, but I just don't feel all that affectionate anymore.\n\nNow, some background.... we've been having some consistent arguments in our relationship lately, namely me expecting him to be more cleanly and responsible with household stuff and money. He owns up to his mistakes, and he's very slowly and intermittently making some improvements but not without constant prodding. Occasionally I'm very capable of being patient with him but much of the time it feels like I have an adolescent child and it's tiresome. He likes to bring up his high-functioning autism a lot as an excuse, but some days he really just puts no effort into being a functional adult in ways that don't immediately interest him, he seems lazy and it pains me to think that if I were to leave him alone for a week, his (now our) room might be full of trash, dirty dishes piled up, our belongings ruined by the dog he's too oblivious to discipline, etc..\n\nWhat complicates things though is that this is my first relationship so I have no reference points for my own behavior and feelings; I'm also clinically depressed and have been having inconsistencies with my meds so that blurs things on my side potentially, and I grew up in home mostly free of physical and verbal affection. I don't know if it's him or me or just the end of the honeymoon phase.\n\nThe thought of breaking up makes me horribly upset, and I'm still putting up with this shit so obviously I care about him a lot. But the fact that I am hardly affectionate towards him anymore makes me unsure of what I'm really feeling. I don't know if I can rekindle the romantic \"spark\" or if it has been lost amongst the weekly lectures, or if I'm just not an affectionate person. I don't know what to do.\n\n*Tl;dr:* my boyfriend doesn't know how to adult and I think having to teach him is making me lose romantic interest. But it also might just be my personality.
