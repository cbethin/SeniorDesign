I\u2019m a college student and I\u2019m on my fifth semester of college. My gpa is very low because I failed two semesters of college because of my depression, I had no motivation to do anything and I essentially could not see a future for myself. Not to mention I had undiagnosed ADHD which made it that much more difficult for me to pass my classes. I\u2019ve managed to get myself together and stay in college.\nBut this semester has been particularly difficult for me; I am now on meds for Depression, anxiety, and adhd. However I haven\u2019t taken my meds in a long time because I am upset at the fact that it seems I am unable to function without medicine, whereas my friends and family don\u2019t need to swallow six pills everyday in order to be functional members of society. \nRecently, I\u2019ve been having a very difficult time. I have cried everyday for the past month or so. I\u2019m beginning to hate my room because I have cried so much in it, that all I can think about when I walk in is how sad I am. I\u2019m usually able to hide my depression quite well from my friends and family, partly because I\u2019m a very private person, and also because my depression is my problem and I feel like no one else should have to deal with it. A lot of my friends tell me I\u2019m a ray of sunshine in their lives, and that I make them very happy and they look forward to seeing me and talking to me everyday, and I\u2019m happy that I can be sunshine to other people, but I wish I wasn\u2019t burning up inside. At times I hang out with friends and it takes everything in me to not burst into tears. But I\u2019ve been pretending for so long that I think I\u2019m forgetting how to. \nRecently I\u2019ve been slipping up, my depression has been finding its way out of my head and into my words. People are starting to notice, people are starting to offer up their support, people are starting to ask if I\u2019m okay, and I hate it. I hate that I can no longer keep up the facade, because I\u2019m overflowing. I hate that I\u2019m so exhausted. I hate that my roommates have heard me cry through the walls. I hate that I can\u2019t even keep it together at school. I hate that I fight back tears during lunch. I hate that I can\u2019t speak during lunch because I\u2019m scared my voice will shake. I hate that I can\u2019t even pretend to be happy anymore. \nWhat am I gonna do when I can\u2019t be anyone\u2019s sunshine anymore? Everyone will leave, because no one wants to deal with this. They\u2019ll talk behind my back about how they\u2019re \u201cworried about me\u201d. I\u2019ll be alone, and out in the open for everyone to see. \nI feel like I\u2019m losing myself and I don\u2019t know what to do. Getting out of bed is hard. Sleeping is hard. Eating is hard. I\u2019ve lost 20lbs in the past month. I sit at my desk to do homework but I just cry. I cry until I can\u2019t anymore. I wake up with swollen eyes, and I continue to cry. I stand still as the days pass through me. I\u2019m isolating myself from my friends. I don\u2019t even remember what my laugh sounds like. \nWhenever I had a bad day, I used to tell myself that the sun would rise, and it was easy to believe this before because truly, the sun did rise. But now, it\u2019s been dark for so long, it doesn\u2019t seem like the sun is coming up anytime soon. I\u2019m finding it hard to convince myself that this darkness will be followed by a sunrise, and this scares me because this was the only thing that got me through the night. this night is the longest it\u2019s ever been.
