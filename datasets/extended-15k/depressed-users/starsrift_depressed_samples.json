To start, I liked the raids, when I had time to do them with my clan. Ultimately, life changes has left me unable to do them for some time, but I still liked them. I thought they were picking up in popularity, between the School Bus and Rivens making the difficulty of them much easier. I always saw people looking for LoR in Recruiting chat if I hung out there for a few minutes, but I'm sure you have better data than I do, DE. \n\nI get why you're retiring them. If you constantly have to patch them for whatever reason, it's a drain on resource, and without taking the time to rework them to make them more appealing to everyone, it's not a good time sink. I understand. And both the Teralyst bounties AND the preview of the new Dark Sectors looks better than the Trials. I'll take those over the Trials, for sure. \n\n\nBut here's my point and complaint. \n\nIf one of the reasons you're getting rid of the Trials is that it no longer fit with the gameplay of Warframe, standing and waiting - why do you have to do the exact same thing to advance with anything with PoE? Fishing and mining isn't optional. You have to do these to advance through the ranks, get better amps, and even use your Archwing to fly around. But it's the same gameplay interference mechanic, standing around and waiting. I get that it's experimental gameplay and you wanted to see if people would go for it, but I and so many others have found it to be a real problem with PoE. Now, you *could* fix that, put fish and ore drops on destructibles or enemy loot, sure, okay, whatever, but --\n\nWhy the dichotomy? Why was it okay for a \"new\" mechanic but sufficient to retire an old one? Did you guys just get caught up in the open world idea and not stop to consider, or what's going on over there? It's like we're hearing two different stories. \n\nAnyway, I'm really happy with the patches so far this year, especially this balance patch. Those fixes to Chroma, Ember, and Zephyr, definitely all needed to come, and I know you're hearing a lot of complaints about the Ember nerfs - but they were definitely correct. Turning on WoF and ignoring everything was not good. I'm looking forward to getting back into Warframe, when I can. I watch the GF play sometimes.\n\nBut not if I have to grind out fishing and mining.

He had no reason to provoke Raubhan at that juncture, having already proven himself a better fighter by taking The Bull's arm (except for dramatic effect, I suppose). \n\nSecond, in HW, if we're to believe that Lolorito was a master manipulator who brought this whole thing about to save the institution of the sultanate, how could have missed Raubhan turning homicidal at the events in question and not seek to advise Raubhan beforehand? (Admittedly, he seemed to gain from Raubhan killing Teledji but that wasn't a sure thing; Raubhan's proclivities were inclined to guide him to kill all of the Monetarists, including Lolorito, so wouldn't it have made more sense to bring The Bull in on the conspiracy?).", "spoiler": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ffxiv", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "thumbnail": "spoiler", "title": "Story Questions re: Heavensward [HW Spoilers]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/7dzf6s/story_questions_re_heavensward_hw_spoilers/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "starsrift", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510846388, "domain": "ea.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7dd4lp/4_years_ago_peter_moore_formerly_of_ea_wrote_we/", "id": "7dd4lp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/gaming/comments/7dd4lp/4_years_ago_peter_moore_formerly_of_ea_wrote_we/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "DtTz0BId_hAiOU13BL5spyic-rzs-qj9fSp4w5Lr_ik", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/559qGxLTzDi3U8yZX4W8Dgya6uLD33QN_PnkLp8ZHZw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=76bc1e65cafc5c7245acc25ac09e7a48", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/559qGxLTzDi3U8yZX4W8Dgya6uLD33QN_PnkLp8ZHZw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=c8cada909984f246896598638cea5259", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/559qGxLTzDi3U8yZX4W8Dgya6uLD33QN_PnkLp8ZHZw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=ac9d4563bd8346cfe292af9f1ca81853", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/559qGxLTzDi3U8yZX4W8Dgya6uLD33QN_PnkLp8ZHZw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=ea42e20bf972842ee5f7a2f09e36c04c", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 431, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/559qGxLTzDi3U8yZX4W8Dgya6uLD33QN_PnkLp8ZHZw.jpg?s=c152813b4fc78218dd4ba3d6e632269b", "width": 766}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1510922346, "score": 7, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "gaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/W1eusujowT7IBGPKg8xp6MsozuLV0QGfCcdceijGvDA.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 78, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "4 years ago, Peter Moore (formerly) of EA wrote \"We can do better\" Gamers bought it.

In the middle of the night, SEA players filter over to NA West. Now, the SEA server's toxicity is so legendary that I hardly blame them, but they play a very different kind of doto than what we're used to. And if you've never seen it, I'll explain -\n\nThey farm for 5-10 minutes, then go mid and clash. And they do NOT stop clashing. Where an NA or EU player set may slow down and say, \"Let them take the tower, let's go farm so we can fight them,\" or, \"Let's take another tower instead,\" or whatnot, these guys just immediately buy a tp on respawn and go back to the fight, or walk if their TP is still on cooldown from their last death. It's literally insane. They can't back down from the fight, no matter how much gold their deaths feed. Winning heroes here include heavily survivable ones, or heavy nukers - WK, PA, WR, Lina, etc.\nAnd I'm not sure how to outsmart it. Normally, if teams are clustering around mid, you just go and take a side lane, split push. Except that doesn't work, because these guys are heedless of odds. They don't merely Mexican-Standoff at mid waiting for someone to mess up to start a favorable fight -- they just go in and fight, and if you're splitpushing on another lane, that's a 4v5. Your team will relentlessly feed the other team kill after kill, and all you have to show for it is a tower (before someone tp's back to stop you from taking the T2 - and they've suddenly quite outlevelled you from farming your allies!).\nFight at mid with your team, and the fight will continue until a tower is down, and everyone moves to a new tower to do the same thing. It's doto, but not as we know it.\n\nSo far the best thing I've found is to play a hard roamer like Bane or Mirana and just try to make sure all my lanes win by ganking them. I also play on NA East when my ping permits. But even roaming hard on NA W still turns into a crapshoot of who winds up feeding the enemy team more, sometimes, especially when the \"winning\" team inevitably overextends to take rax and throw their killstreaks. I'm not a pro in hiding. I'm a scrublord player, but I want to play doto, not this festering mess! Anyone have any other ideas of how to escape and get my MMR to somewhere where I can start to play doto again?\n\nI just wanted to add, playing at Christmas time with all you college kids on break and playing doto has been a treat, caustic and venomous as you can be.
