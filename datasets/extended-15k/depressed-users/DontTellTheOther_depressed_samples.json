I have always just pushed everything down and and tried to ignore it.  Which as many of you will know is the definite wrong thing to do.  Now at 30 years old it all started boiling over.  Everything is too much, my marriage is in a bad place, my dog has cancer, I hate my job, I feel hopeless for the future of the world, and hate where I live.  \n\nSo after much pushing from my mom and sister I finally saw someone.  At first I was wanting to just do talk therapy, thinking I've dealt with it all these years surely talk therapy is enough to get things back under control.... nope.  I honestly feel worse now.  We discussed my official diagnosis tonight and she said I need to go to someone for medication immediately. I know it's horrible thinking, but I feel defective and like a failure for not being able to handle life on my own.\n\nI was diagnosed with severe depression, general anxiety disorder, and social anxiety.\n\nI just had to get it off my chest to others who will understand.  I feel so overwhelmed and like I suck at life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 398821, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finally decided to get help and got my diagnosis today....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9r5ign/finally_decided_to_get_help_and_got_my_diagnosis/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
