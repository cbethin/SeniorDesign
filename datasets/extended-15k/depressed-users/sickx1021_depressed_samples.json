And I think also for attention. Because if I\u2019m being 100% honest I kind of want someone to see it and realize that I\u2019m suffering and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so terrible at living my life recently. I\u2019m done with people seeing me as lazy. I need them to get it. I need help.\n\nI used a pencil sharpener blade. It took a second for the cuts to start bleeding and I worried I went too deep. But they didn\u2019t bleed much until I put alcohol on them. I got very scared and immediately regretted doing so many cuts. It looks scary on my arm. \n\nBut I\u2019m probably going to do it again. I\u2019m scared of what I\u2019m doing but unless something else changes I don\u2019t see another way.

It\u2019s not like I stay in bed for a month straight and eat nothing and don\u2019t shower for that whole month, and then it\u2019s over and I feel good again. \n\nInstead, for me, it\u2019s like I always feel the symptoms of depression. Some days I feel a little better, and do some homework and feel motivated to change. But then the very next day it\u2019s back. It\u2019s not like I have concrete depressive episodes. People describe it as losing time, like they just slept and did nothing and didn\u2019t even realize that weeks were passing. I have never had that. For me, it\u2019s more like time is passing super fast, and I\u2019m just stuck. But I\u2019m very aware of it all.\n\nThis was even present when I was in high school. I missed a bunch of school days due to what I believed was depression but they were scattered. I didn\u2019t miss a week at a time- it would be like once a week. I never disappear or fall of the face of the earth.\n\nIt still affects my life extremely but appears as more of a personality thing than an illness because it\u2019s just always there. And now I\u2019m starting to think it is in fact just a personality trait: extreme laziness. \n\nI was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I think I might have exaggerated my experience or misinterpreted the symptoms on the questionnaires.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 405535, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mistaking laziness for depression", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9wvylg/mistaking_laziness_for_depression/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
