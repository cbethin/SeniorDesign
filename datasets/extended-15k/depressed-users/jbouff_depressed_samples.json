We\u2019ve always had an amazing, strong relationship, or so I thought. I was putting dinner on his plate, a normal evening, until he mentioned he didn\u2019t want much because his stomachs been upset and he can\u2019t eat. When I asked why... that\u2019s when my world ended. We have been together for 11 years, engaged for only 4 months. For the last 5 years, I\u2019ve been living with terminal cancer and he\u2019s been my rock. My mental health has been very touchy as one can imagine having incurable cancer and he\u2019s been the one thing keeping me here and fighting. I actually did a clinical trial that surprisingly helped me. We\u2019re just getting to a place with my health where maybe I can live a \u201cnormal\u201d life. We\u2019re supposed to be leaving on vacation in a few weeks and finally got to a point where we can plan things for the future. Theres so much coming up. I\u2019ve been improving myself and my mental health A LOT. He says he sees these improvements and they should make him happy, but it doesn\u2019t. He told me when I just had my scans, he should\u2019ve felt something, but he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s lost his compassion for me and isn\u2019t in love with me anymore. I supported him through school and now that he\u2019s done, he\u2019s not only my emotional, but my financial rock, as well as helping me with things my disability makes hard. I don\u2019t have much family and I lost a lot of people when I was diagnosed with cancer. He threw in my face that he wants children and I can\u2019t provide that (this isn\u2019t anything new) and when I said I was getting to a point in my health where I could start looking into options for how to have kids he said, \u201ceven if we could, is it smart to bring a child into this world not knowing if they\u2019ll have a mom around?\u201d Not being able to have kids has been one of the hardest things that i struggle with, and he knows that and always reassured me that I was more important. I didn\u2019t even know this person talking to me. So cold, empty. I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn\u2019t have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. He told me he\u2019s not happy with his life and his priorities have changed and he doesn\u2019t want to resent me. We never even argued. We were the couple people looked up to and my life collapsed around me in a matter of seconds. I\u2019m having to tell people today and they\u2019re not even believing it. Everything was perfect and then everything was gone. I don\u2019t know how to live without him. I don\u2019t even know how I can make this work. I\u2019m so hurt and angry. Why propose mere months ago after 10 years just for this to happen? How can you just leave as things were getting okay and after I had everything in my life already ripped away with cancer and was trying to figure out how to rebuild and finally have a \u201cnormal\u201d life? I haven\u2019t slept, I can\u2019t eat. I\u2019m scared of what I might do when reality sets in. I\u2019m going to die alone. Nobody wants to be with the amputee with cancer and I\u2019m devastated. My self esteem has never been lower. I can\u2019t have kids. I\u2019m going to die alone. And a part of me wishes my cancer was bad again and it would take me sooner so I don\u2019t have to do this anymore. I\u2019m so over these cards I\u2019ve been dealt. I had a 20% chance of still being alive in March, and he won\u2019t be there by my side. I don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never be okay again.
