My second oldest brother is the obvious GC, I feel like I fit more into the lost child role at the moment, having times in childhood where I was treated like a GC (being the youngest) and times as an SG (when defending my sister). \n\nI can\u2019t express my emotions well and cry when in confrontational situations. I hate that I can\u2019t be as strong and determined as my SG sister. There\u2019s a lot of guilt over situations when I haven\u2019t supported her. My sister has been a substitute mother figure in my life, I depend on her a lot but find it difficult to support her. She helps me through all of my shit, gets me through with pep talks and is genuinely trying to help me. \n\nMy SG sister is going through a stressful time. When she comes to me for advice, I panic. I can\u2019t think. She, understandably, gets annoyed that I\u2019m taking it too seriously. Even minor decisions, like deciding where to get food, make me panic and I defer decision making to her. When she came to me for advice yesterday, it was a repeat of all the other times. She brings up what is bothering her and I go quiet. In my mind, theres blankness. I\u2019m trying so hard to think of what to say. Sometimes I\u2019m genuinely thinking of a solution or something to help her, but struggle to verbalise until I have a coherent thought by which point its too late. I feel like I have to have an answer. I also struggle with saying what I think people want to hear. I cry when she gets annoyed at me, which turns a situation that was about her problems into something about me. It makes her feel guilty for creating a situation where I cry, which makes her feel like there\u2019s no one to help her. She has no one else to go to, she\u2019s always fixing other people\u2019s problems. I don\u2019t intend for her to feel guilty, I don\u2019t want to cry, but the result of my actions always makes her feel worse. Another issue is that my advice is always obvious, she tells me that she could\u2019ve thought of that herself, and what was the point in coming to me. Although she says this bluntly, I know its out of frustration and ultimately, as much as it hurts, its true. \n\nThe worst feeling is wishing that the situation will end, I care so much for her, but I hold back and only think of myself wanting it to stop. It's a situation that makes me feel uncomfortable, not having the answers makes me uncomfortable so I would rather ignore the problem and brush it under the carpet like I do with all my problems. Its selfish and shows that I don\u2019t care about her as much as I care about myself, but I want it to stop.\n\nMy SG sister and I are close as hell. She\u2019s my only friend, we go everywhere together. Because she\u2019s older than me, I feel like I don\u2019t have the experience or the knowledge on certain things she\u2019s struggling with to tell her or advise her. If I have a problem, like about university, she can tell me from a perspective of having been through something similar or just about university in general. I feel that because I don\u2019t have that experience, that what I say or suggest will be wrong.\n\nI want to know if anyone else has experienced this. All I want is to be able to help my sister, to offer advice in a calm way, to think about things rationally. Any tips on how to overcome this, or what you would want to see from an SG perspective?
