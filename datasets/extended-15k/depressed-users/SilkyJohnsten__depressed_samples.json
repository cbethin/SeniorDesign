I was a total and complete train-wreck of a human being, and was thoroughly riddled with anxiety on a regular/daily basis. I had significant suicidal ideations that ultimately scared me into actually seeking help for my affliction. A couple of years have gone by now and I've continued to struggle with anxiety, primarily socially, but it's been tolerable enough. \n\nI was put on 300mg of Wellbutrin XL, twice daily. It has been a really significant help and since going on it I went back to school, got myself into a nice position at work, and purchased a house. It's been a really, really positive experience overall. \n\nHowever, over the handful of months I haven't felt the same with them. Really unmotivated, 0 anxiety toward things not regarding people. Things like work deadlines, school deadlines, like I just haven't been giving a shit at all. Not a good thing. So, I spoke with my GP that referred me to my psychologist and told him I was thinking about cutting my dose in half. He was on board, but told me to be careful. So, I did that, but have also gone long spurts without taking them at all. Then take one for a couple days, miss a dose, take one, miss a couple, and so on. This has gone on for a couple months now. \n\nI'm posting this because, I feel really, really good. And that sort of scares me. Like, I feel the drive to do my school work, to perform well at work. I actually have the desire to pick up my guitar again. And it scares the shit out of me because I don't want to risk going back to where I was in an effort to try and turn the page to what the goal for me has always been, which is complete recovery. What if it's all fools gold, you know? \n\nI would appreciate any feedback from people that may have been there before and share any input that you feel might be helpful, if you feel like sharing it.

I like my job, my bosses are awesome, my co-worker is both a great person and has been an excellent resource to learn from.

I know this is premature that I haven't even been offered a position, but I feel I will compete well and have a strong chance at it. \n\nWith this background in mind, my question to you is.. How much opportunity is there in IT? I don't want to leave a job that I enjoy, but is completely outside of any CS discipline, for a potentially dead end role.
