I'm in pain both mentally and physically. The things I used to find joy in have no value to me anymore. And I just simply don't know what else to do.\n\nI've been in therapy for years, and on meds as well. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD about four years ago, and have been tossed from medication to medication ever since then, to no avail. My shrink--I'm on the seventh one now--can't seem to find a proper mix of meds to soothe my brain. I've been hospitalized four times (all voluntarily) and left feeling better. Each time that \"feel-better\" phase lasted maybe two weeks. Around friends, with family, with or without a significant other, or completely alone, I always just think of how I would be better off dead. I used to have wonderful friends, but I've pushed them all away with my reclusiveness. The one and only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want my family to be upset. But even with that thought, I feel like I grow closer every day.\n\nRecently I quit the best job I've ever had because I was just miserable. I cried on the way to work every day, even though my job was awesome and I was lucky to have it. Now I cry every day because I'm unemployed and have literally no money. I shut myself off in my room all day every day, and it fucking sucks. But I know as soon as I get another job, I'll be miserable there too. It wouldn't matter if I got my dream job, I just simply won't be happy and I know it. Not to mention my dream job is impossible because I only have an associate's degree, no real skills, and very little experience in any given field because of the way I've always jumped from job to job in different industries. I have mounting financial problems that are becoming impossible to ignore.\n\nNothing brings me happiness, not even things like reading or working out, both activities I used to genuinely love. I'm gaining weight because I can't force myself out of bed to go to the gym. I used to look great, but now I hate my body. I can't calm my racing thoughts enough to concentrate on reading or writing; my brain is sluggish but somehow always a cacophony that never shuts up. I eat like shit because I can't afford decent food, and that just makes me feel worse as well as contributes to my growing weight problem.\n\nI recently rediscovered the little coin purse filled with razor blades that I used to cut until I quit about a year ago, and they have never looked more enticing. I sleep with them under my pillow every night. Why, I don't know, but I guess it's because they give me some weird sense of security. I am simply itching to cut again, and it's taking all my willpower not to do it, because I fear I will go overboard and end up killing myself.\n\nIn all reality, I would benefit from going inpatient somewhere again, but I don't have insurance anymore since I turned 26 and I simply cannot afford the medical bills. It's all I can do to pay for therapy and medication, both of which are doing nothing for me.\n\nSorry that this is an incoherent, jumbled mess. As I mentioned, my thoughts are racing like fucking crazy. I just really needed to vent somewhere.
