It probably also developed due to ADHD that went undiagnosed until I was 20. \nI\u2019ve been working really hard to overcome it, but in the last few months I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m nothing but an empty shell. \n\nI wanted to be an illustrator since I was a kid and I went to college for art. After I got done I took a break from art for a while due to school burn out, but when I tried to pick it back up, I felt like I was forcing myself. \nI\u2019ve been trying to focus on fixing myself and \u201cself love\u201d: my skincare, taking better care of my hair, getting my meds on time, etc but I still hate myself so, so much. I try to focus on the things I\u2019ve accomplished and I can\u2019t feel proud about any of them. They all feel like nothing. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to be healthier. I realized that because of the autoimmune, I can\u2019t eat gluten. I also can\u2019t even eat bananas. So I\u2019ve cut it all out.  I do feel better but just physically. \n\nI also have social anxiety. I can function fine enough at work because I know what to do, but when it comes to situations where I don\u2019t have a \u201crole\u201d or guidance on what to do, I start shaking and feel like crying. I need to leave immediately. \n\nI feel like the poster child for the millennial snowflake stereotype. ADHD, food restrictions, social anxiety, failed artist. \nI have a full time job right now and in spite of all the positive feedback I\u2019m getting, I always feel like I\u2019m failing. \n\nI\u2019ve been married to my husband for almost 2 years and the rejection sensitive dysphoria and the social anxiety are affecting our marriage. He\u2019s much more extroverted than I am and he likes to go out and have friends over regularly. I feel better staying at home doing home things. I feel like I\u2019m so boring and sad. I\u2019m 24 and I don\u2019t feel inclinations to go to parties or have fun. In fact, I\u2019ve never been to a real party for more than 20 minutes. The one party I did go to, I had a panic attack and had to leave. \n\nNothing really feels fun for me anymore. Even when I do have fun, I still feel sad in the back of my mind because I know it will end, or because I\u2019m scared this is the last time I\u2019ll have fun. My husband took off for my birthday last Saturday, and we spent the entire time doing things we both love, but I was also worried I wasn\u2019t really enjoying things or that I was inconveniencing him. \n\nI\u2019m scared he doesn\u2019t enjoy being with me anymore. He\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve ever felt understood and truly loved by. I try to do things to show him my love. I\u2019ll surprise him at work, bring him snacks, eat out and pay for his meal. I want to get him a PS4 for Christmas because I know he wants one. But I think all of that gets ruined whenever I have a panic attack going out, or when I freak out because people are coming over in short notice, or if he does something that triggers my RSD. \nSome time ago we had a huge fight and he told me he had lost faith in our relationship. I ran out of the room feeling like I wanted to die and he apologized and said he didn\u2019t mean it, and he had only said it out of anger. \nThings have been like before since then but...even if he really didn\u2019t mean it, I can\u2019t help but feel like our relationship is ruined. Thinking about it makes me want to die. He\u2019s the only thing I have left to hold on to, and if I lose him, I really won\u2019t have anything left to motivate me to stay alive. \nHe\u2019s been taking care to be extra sweet and does things to make me feel loved, but that somehow only makes me feel worse. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I have anyone to talk to about it. My mom always makes subtle digs at me whenever I talk to her. If i ever hinted at having problems in my marriage or that i still have depression issues (which she didn\u2019t want to ever accept), she\u2019ll have a field day. Honestly, I ought to go on r/raisedbynarcissists because of her but I was the golden child (before I was 17) so I feel like I had it easier than most people there. I\u2019ve never been able to talk to my dad about anything. He does not like to deal with emotions, and he either makes me feel like I\u2019m ruining my life or makes me feel he\u2019s struggled way more than me, so I have no reason to be sad. \n\nAll my friends are depressed too (like everyone else in our generation), so I don\u2019t want to burden them with this. \nDon\u2019t have time or a car to see a therapist. I\u2019ve tried a few antidepressants but I didn\u2019t feel any different. \nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that whenever I hear or see something about wanting to gain happiness, I feel like crying because it feels like I\u2019ll never be happy again. \n\nI had so many dreams and so many people who believed in me, and now just thinking about it makes me sad instead of motivating me. Makes me wish I\u2019d just die in my sleep so people would think I died before my prime, and not let them see that i was never going to do anything with my life.

I was diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s about 4-5 years ago. Got tested for celiac\u2019s a while back but came up negative. I\u2019m going GF anyway because any time I eat foods with gluten I find myself bloated and in pain within an hour. \nI\u2019ve noticed, though, that it seems eating things with gluten but also a lot of sugar make my reactions worse? Like, when I was like 19, I ate a real sugary donut. Woke up at 3AM in horrible pain, barfed every few hours for about 24 hours. A few weeks ago, I hadn\u2019t eaten much bread, but then I had some orange chicken (breaded and a sugary sauce) and immediately I was in so much pain. Every time I have pan dulce, cake, etc, I feel nauseous, my stomach expands like 3x its size, I have horrible pain, and then (TMI) either have horrible, extremely painful constipation, or extremely painful stomach pain that is quickly followed by diarrhea. I have, no joke, felt multiple times I was gonna die in the toilet lmao. \n\nIt\u2019s not always sugary breads that cause this, like I had a gyro wrap in August and within 20 minutes I broke into a cold sweat, had horrible pain, and diarrhea. It\u2019s hard to feel lower than when you\u2019re exploding in a tiny Walgreens bathroom. But anyway, generally non-sugary smaller things that have gluten, like pasta or flour tortillas, don\u2019t  seem to hurt nearly as much or as quickly (they do hurt tho).

Last year\u2019s was filled with art supplies and books on art, while this year\u2019s was just clothes and jewelry. \n\nThinking about that helped me realize that this year has been more about really defining who I am as a person. I graduated in May and I kind of fell into a slump with my art since then, but I\u2019ve been getting to know myself better. I\u2019ve always defined myself through grades and through my art, but when I graduated, I didn\u2019t have these things to define me anymore and I was left with just myself and really having to address my bottled up self hatred. \n\nReddit helped a lot, actually. I learned I have fungal acne thanks to r/SkincareAddiction, learned more about dressing myself to fit my body better and the image I want, as well as clothes in general through r/FemaleFashionAdvice, and most recently, learned my \u201cunruly straight hair\u201d was actually badly kept wavy hair thanks to someone linking r/curlyhair in this sub (too bad I learned this after chopping it into a pixie, but in a sense this is good because now my new hair won\u2019t be subjected to damage from straightening blowouts and brushing). \n\nI also got my shit together and started treating my ADHD and autoimmune disorder again. I found a full time temp-to-hire job that I actually seem to be doing really well at. I\u2019ve been working on both my mental health, and my physical health: analyzing my anxieties and triggers, but also taking up jogging and eating a little better. I\u2019ve been more involved in helping my community. Oh, and I self-published my very first complete graphic novel, something I had given up hope I\u2019d ever do. These are just a few among many other accomplishments I\u2019d taken for granted. \n\nNow that I don\u2019t have tests to study for or artwork to complete on a deadline, after 23.5 years, I finally had time to focus on just myself. It feels like I\u2019m excusing laziness when I tell myself that I\u2019m worth spending time on. I\u2019ve spent the better part of these 24 years focused on being a good student and being a good artist. I deserve to spend sometime focusing on being a better me. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest. I hope some of you can also relate. We tend to ask so much success of ourselves, but ignore that our own physical selves are basically projects and experiments too.

I'm really bad about refilling my prescription and have at times gone months without meds (only going back when I see my thighs getting bigger or can't stay warm).  \nI found this sub yesterday and I see people talking about things like flare ups, how hashis makes their life so much harder, etc. I never heard of that. I was never even told this is a chronic illness.\n\nHow do I know if I'm having a flare up? I know I have depressive episodes/weeks sometimes, is that part of it? Could my IBS be linked to the Hashis? Does Hashis flare ups have similar symptoms to IBS?  \n\n\nI do know that I just feel exhausted constantly. Last Saturday I went to bed at 7:30pm and woke up at 7am, except it was daylight savings, so really, I slept 13 hours. I felt great at first, but by 11:30 I was falling asleep again. Sleeping less than 8 hours guarantees I'll be exhausted enough for it to impair my functioning. Sleeping 8 hours is best, but I'm still yawning and sluggish throughout the day. Sleeping over 8 hours gives me stomach aches and anxiety. How do people deal with this?\n\n  \nI also have the WORST dry skin. When I'm at work, I'll put off going to the bathroom for hours (unhealthy, I know) because I don't want to deal with painfully dry hands after washing. My new job has eucerin next to the bathroom sinks (thank god) but on colder days, I can still feel the dryness and it takes my hands hours to feel comfortable again (and by then, I probably need to use the restroom again...sigh...). Applying more lotion doesn't work. I'm dreading the colder weather because I get cracks all over my hands, not just the knuckles but the skin on the back of my hand, and the webbing between index and thumb. I told my gp this last time I saw him, but since my tsh levels are perfect, he didn't bother with it.  \nWith adderall, I'm sweaty, but the rest of me is so cold. I spend the day putting on a jacket or sweater, then taking it off in 10 minutes because it's too hot, then putting it back on again after a while, and so on. Also gloves do NOT work for me. I've tried cotton, leather, leather lined with fleece. Nothing, my hands are still popsicles.  \nI also think I have an iron deficiency? Even though I have light medium skin, I'm often told how pale I look. If I don't wear lipstick, I look like I just got pulled out of an ice bath. I've heard you can't take iron supplements, so how can I increase it in my diet? Beans flare up my IBS. I'm at an impasse, lol!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do any of you deal with any of this?

I feel like im extremely high strung and even a bit controlling because of it, but his apparent aloofness and lack of urgency kill me. \n\nFor example, if something pops into my mind that starts stressing me out, I need to drop everything and fix it RIGHT NOW or else I won\u2019t be able to think about anything else. On the other hand, if something stressful pops into his mind, his first response is to ignore it until it\u2019s impossible to ignore or make a decision about it that isn\u2019t good in the long run. Obviously these are both unhealthy reactions because needing to reformat our budget at 3AM just because I woke up and thought of it, or cancelling already made plans because i remembered something else isn\u2019t ideal...But neither is putting off paying tolls, making doctors appointments, or getting up on time in the morning. \n\nSometimes when I remind him of his responsibilities, he\u2019ll get really quiet with me and sometimes even snappy (especially when it comes to things like waking up in the morning). We\u2019ve gotten into arguments because I\u2019ll get upset that we left a friends\u2019 house super late (and his friends live over an hour away) in spite of having work early the next morning, but even when we don\u2019t have work the next day, if we were supposed to do productive things like grocery shopping or laundry, I get upset that we stayed too late because I know we\u2019ll feel tired and lazy the next day. I\u2019ve tried explaining it to him and he just doesn\u2019t see it. He says we can just do things later but it\u2019s like he forgets that we SUCK at motivating ourselves after 5pm. He always says THIS time we will do it on time. \nI know I shouldn\u2019t be so high strung either, but it\u2019s hard to tell when it\u2019s ok to let things go and when it\u2019s not. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me? I\u2019ve tried introducing him to the healthier coping mechanisms I\u2019ve learned but he either doesn\u2019t try them, doesn\u2019t stick to them, or modifies them in a way that makes them useless. I know he\u2019d be doing better if he were medicated, but he won\u2019t make the appointment! And I can\u2019t make it for him. Obviously he needs different mechanisms than the ones that help me. \n\nPlease help. I love him so much but I\u2019m tired of feeling like his mom.

Many of my symptoms have subsided ever since starting treatment, except for my ridiculously dry skin (on my body, no issues on my face).  \nIt's really affecting my daily life, it's so bad. If I get my hands wet, even without using soap, I immediately need to moisturize lest they feel so dry that I can't extend my fingers fully. My shins are so dry it almost hurts. I have rough and dark elbows and knees. Carrying moisturizer around for my hands does very little. Because of the thyroid problem, my hands get cold very easily and exacerbate the dryness, so even moisturizing after hand washing can leave me with uncomfortable hands for up to an hour afterwards.\n\nIt's gotten so bad that I will avoid using the restroom so I don't have to wash my hands, which is very bad for my bladder obviously.\n\nHere's what I've tried:\n\n\\-moisturizing right out of the shower or with still damp skin. Instead of helping my skin absorb the water, it just felt sliiightly less dry and I still had to use more moisturizer once I was completely dry  \n\\-moisturizing and immediately putting on cotton pants   \n\\-soap for sensitive skin, or not using soap at all if I showered with soap the previous day.\n\n\\-Showering in lukewarm or even cold water\n\n\\-salicylic acid on my elbows, knees, ankles, and back of arms (I also have KP). It stung quite a bit and didn't seem to do much.  \n\\-CeraVe (both the blue and salicylic acid versions--these helped the most but run out fast when you literally have to apply it to your entire body), Jergens ultra healing extra dry skin (does not help, also dislike fragrance), multiple suave ones, rose body oil (did not absorb and also very strong scent).\n\nWhat's really frustrating is that the moisturizers don't really last until the next day. Even if I don't shower every day, I have to moisturize MY WHOLE BODY every day, and I really don't have time for that.\n\n I'm also really focused on finding something I can put on my hands. The dry winter weather will cause cracks on my knuckles and the webbing between my thumb and index. Also, my fingertips shrivel up as if I just swam. I've tried bath and body works stuff (no-go for obvious reasons), EOS (which specifically said would last even through hand washes---wrong), multiple kinds of eucerin, and the latest has been the burts bees hand salve, which does not absorb fast and also has a very strong scent. I did try a \"Norwegian Formula\" Neutrogena one that my husband was gifted and that one worked really well, especially if I emulsified it a bit first (it's very thick and takes a while to sink in if I don't add  bit of water). I haven't tried it again because I can't seem to find it in stores, and I keep trying others in hopes that another will work so I don't have to order online.\n\nI want to get squalane for my face and I'm thinking I might also try it on my hands, elbows, knees, shins, and ankles (my driest spots). Do you guys think that's a good idea/might work? Anyone have similar problems that they've managed better than I have?\n\nI'm sorry for the rant.

It's starting to get really shaggy and shapeless so it's definitely time for a trim, but I'm debating on whether or not I should bother with going to a stylist who specializes on curly hair. \n\nPros: There's a salon here that has consistent 5 star reviews and on top of doing the whole process by sticking to Lorraine Massey's specs, they also give you styling tips (and they focus on the method over products, a good sign to me), which I desperately need. I also want this virgin growth to have the best possible head start on eventually being healthy, long wavy hair since I previously brushed my long hair and blow dried it with a round brush, only to end up with helmet hair on top and poofy, tangly frizz on the bottom half (which is why I got a pixie in the first place)\n\nCons: it\u2019s $80 and I\u2019ve literally never spent more than like $32 on a haircut (and even that $32 was unfair because the lady styled my hair without asking me if I wanted that/telling me it was extra). I\u2019m also still trying to figure my hair out because I don\u2019t get consistent results and idk if it\u2019s lopo or hipo, or if consistent waves won\u2019t show up until my hair reaches my shoulders. Sometimes I have really nice soft, albeit somewhat cowlicky but voluminous waves. Most days I have some flat but defined s-waves in the morning that fall out or look like unbrushed straight hair by noon. On really bad days it\u2019s mostly just straight or ridiculously full of cowlicks with the longest bits having very subtle large waves that still lie flat against my head.

I barely started CG a few days ago and I\u2019ve had mixed results experimenting. Today I though I finally had it, but then when I went to scr\u00f6nch out my cr\u00f6nch, I ended up with my best waves yet...BUT GEL RESIDUE!\n\nYesterday evening I clarified with the Suave clarifying shampoo because my hair looked absolutely nasty after only co-washing all week. I left on my conditioner, Suave Essentials, for 30 minutes, then rinsed by S2C. I didn\u2019t put on any product last night because i wanted to see how my hair would behave without any product. \n\nThis morning I dampened my hair, added LA looks sports gel. Air dried for about 3 hours with some blow drying in between because my hair would not have dried otherwise. I also don\u2019t have a diffuser yet. \nWhen I was doing SOTC, I realized the crunch was turning into loke...tiny cobwebs and dust, at least around my roots. \n\n-I did have a hard time rinsing our all my conditioner last night since I wasn\u2019t /in/ the shower, just leaning into it, could that have done it?\n\n-could it be that because of the length of my hair, the gel is getting too close to my scalp and roots, causing the flakes? I\u2019m not at all itchy or anything though. Definitely not dandruff. \n\n-I do own the herbal essences curly hair mousse (can\u2019t remember the exact name), should I try that instead?\n\n-is it simply that I used too much gel? I feel like in total I only used about 2 quarters size.\n\n \nI\u2019m starting a desk job on Monday and I really do not want to show up with flaky waves, so any help would be super appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "curlyhair", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t79l", "subreddit_subscribers": 129806, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Argh gel residue!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/9pvlsj/argh_gel_residue/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "pompompompi", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "msgd", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_18jhwey", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539901455, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9pdx3e/acne_one_month_into_an_fa_fighting_routine/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9pdx3e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#4a8da2", "link_flair_css_class": "Acne", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "635ca28e-d0cc-11e3-a662-12313b08b431", "link_flair_text": "Acne", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9pdx3e/acne_one_month_into_an_fa_fighting_routine/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539901457, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "subreddit_subscribers": 721198, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "[Acne] One month into an FA fighting routine", "url": "https://imgur.com/a/5fWxPqT", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "pompompompi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_18jhwey", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539895903, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/9pd5fe/long_post_any_tips_for_a_born_again_wavy_more/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9pd5fe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/curlyhair/comments/9pd5fe/long_post_any_tips_for_a_born_again_wavy_more/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539895904, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "curlyhair", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t79l", "subreddit_subscribers": 129285, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "LONG POST.

I read the extremely helpful post here on your first derm visit and I followed as much as I could of it. I must say, I was really disappointed with my visit. I went in there expressly saying I was trying to figure out what it has been in some cosmetics (mostly foundations but also sunscreens) that causes bumps on my face. No pustules or anything, just bumps. My derm went in and told me to up the Differin from every other day to two days on, one day off and prescribed an antibiotic. When I mentioned to her that my main concern was knowing what was in these products that caused that reaction in me, sometimes literally overnight, she sort of blew me off. She said \u201cwe can\u2019t look at a product and tell you what\u2019s going to cause a reaction. We have to see what the chemicals are\u201d which is what i had said. I wanted to know what was IN the product. Then she said to me \u201cbesides, acne takes 10 days to form\u201d. And sure, i believe that. But she should\u2019ve also believed me when I said this stuff was happening the very next day. The bumps I had had we\u2019re improving everyday with the Differin, when suddenly I tried a new foundation and the very next morning my skin had MORE bumps. So it wasn\u2019t even a purge. \n\nI went home that day not so convinced of what she\u2019d told me and I finally decided to research fungal acne. I wanted to make sure I had all the info so I literally spent 5-6 hours just reading and reading (thank you Simple Skincare Science!!). That Friday I went and bought myself some Nizoral and started using it the same way and days as my Differin. Two days on, one day off. \n(It\u2019s important to note that at this point, I had hit a plateau on Differin. Nothing looked different than from the 1st completed month. Bumps kept showing up everyday and there were some flanking my nose that wouldn\u2019t open or shrink or anything. Just eternally there. I was really losing hope). \nI also cut out all the products that had Malassezia-feeding ingredients, which was everything but the cleansers. I went to my city\u2019s one Korean beauty shop and got myself Benton\u2019s Aloe Propolis soothing gel. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t even been a week on this and the difference has already been stark. My skin looks more even, both in texture and color. My oiliness has actually gone down. If i didn\u2019t have this PIE from the Differin, I\u2019d say this is the best my skin has looked since before I started wearing makeup. \n\nI\u2019m planning to slowly add Cosrx\u2019s Centella Toner to up my hydration as the nizoral can be very drying and the Benton gel isn\u2019t a very rich moisturizer at all (although I\u2019ve seen that doing a three-skin layering with it in the mornings and using Vaseline on the nights I don\u2019t treat has been immensely helpful). Eventually I\u2019d also like to add their Snail 96 essence and their Hyaluronic acid essence. All these products are fungal friendly. After 8 weeks of the nizoral, I\u2019ll probably switch to using stridex and sulfur masks to keep the fungus at bay so as to not develop anti-fungal resistance. \n\nI just wanted to make this post to encourage people to listen to what their skin and gut are telling you. If you feel something isn\u2019t quite right, you have the power to research for yourself. Yes, sometimes this can have negative results, but I feel those come from excitement and not from proper research.

I\u2019ll get right to the point. \nEvery single foundation/foundation-like product I\u2019ve ever tried has given me closed comedones. I\u2019ve tried 2 BB creams (Covergirl, and Maybelline), L\u2019Oreal\u2019s trumatch and even a beautiful Laneige cushion. The BB creams gave me CCs all over my chin. I tried using the trumatch thinned our with moisturizer (I don\u2019t like the feel of medium to full coverage) and that gave me more on my cheeks. I started Differin to get rid of all of them and in just two weeks it was performing miracles. Then a worker at Sephora convinced me that the Laneige compact was \u201cmore skincare than makeup\u201d and \u201cswatched\u201d it by putting it all over my face. I didn\u2019t wear that for more than 8 hours and yet I woke up with more CCs than ever. \nI\u2019ve also tried glossier\u2019s stretch concealer, cloud paint, and an NYX powder blush. All gave me CCs. The only thing I\u2019ve put on my face that didn\u2019t give me CCs was using lipstick as blush. \n\nMy skin is generally pretty good. I\u2019ve had a lot of acne in my recovery from all the CCs using Differin but it\u2019s finally getting back to normal. I don\u2019t usually wear foundation anyway, but there\u2019s special occasions when a girl wants to look extra nice!\nMy husband says I should go to a dermatologist and have them test me for things, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something derms do and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m allergic to this stuff. I\u2019ve had allergies on my face before and it did not feel like this. \n\nAny advice?

So when itchy redness appeared on my face, I figured it was either the chrlorine or the soap giving me that reaction. \nI quit the BP after a while because my skin felt too dry on it. But my husband has been using it lately and it's helped him immensely, so i thought \"maybe I'll just use a tiny bit on these stubborn whiteheads and rinse it off after ten minutes!\"\n\nSo I applied and when I went back in 10 I saw whitish dried junk (like what's next to your eyes when you wake up) around where I'd applied. Didn't think much of it for some reason?? \nSo I rinsed it off, but I hadn't washed my hands with soap after applying the BP in the first place. So I add moisturizer and I realize too late that maybe I should've washed them. But I just put on my Vaseline and go to bed. \n\nWoke up in the middle of the night and some spots in my face felt super itchy, but I figured some dog hair probably got stuck to the Vaseline and went back to seep. WELP. The next morning I had inflamed and itchy redness EVERYWHERE. I tried covering it up with a green color corrector but it was no use. \nThe next few days were miserable. The corners of my eyes were itchy, my cheeks were itchy, my entire face burned whenever I put on moisturizer! (Which was just basic CeraVe lotion). I took ibuprofen for the swelling and I slugged it every night. I kept waking up with the Vaseline completely gone wherever the irritation was at its worst. I guess my skin absorbed it? Idk. \nAfter a few days the redness and stinging have finally subsided. Now I'm just left with flakes and rough skin texture, which I hope will resolve itself in a few days as well. \nI've obviously quit all actives this week and have been the most diligent I've ever been about reapplying sunscreen. \n\n\nOn the plus side, my white heads are pretty much gone!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "subreddit_subscribers": 464475, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[personal] realizing I had a BP allergy the hard way", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/854ht0/personal_realizing_i_had_a_bp_allergy_the_hard_way/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "pompompompi", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "msgd", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520551668, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/83237s/humor_lighting_is_everything_i_was_feeling_bummed/", "id": "83237s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "Humor", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Humor"}], "link_flair_text": "Humor", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 198, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/83237s/humor_lighting_is_everything_i_was_feeling_bummed/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "RiloX0gYy8KDFeNTcLpiwrXLljB0Yrf4Jn30FUUe37o", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/jWo2ckIujhC1zgQ3PMJKBKct46kahMhrQvyNAFPkLps.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=172195b19215aa06ab732a63cea60cc0", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/jWo2ckIujhC1zgQ3PMJKBKct46kahMhrQvyNAFPkLps.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=1d00dfec2dfb895eaa29fa12559e2825", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/jWo2ckIujhC1zgQ3PMJKBKct46kahMhrQvyNAFPkLps.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=e3407c77b1ab497c32bf2d1b396d2c81", "width": 320}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/jWo2ckIujhC1zgQ3PMJKBKct46kahMhrQvyNAFPkLps.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=332c6cae557082639cf064d85ca38a0d", "width": 640}, {"height": 960, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/jWo2ckIujhC1zgQ3PMJKBKct46kahMhrQvyNAFPkLps.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=e1e513a1c8514ffcad93f29bcc87db50", "width": 960}, {"height": 1080, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/jWo2ckIujhC1zgQ3PMJKBKct46kahMhrQvyNAFPkLps.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=edc23a7b9f21bb67ba0fe5de192fe58c", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 2560, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/jWo2ckIujhC1zgQ3PMJKBKct46kahMhrQvyNAFPkLps.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;s=d49ee5ca952b0e21bdc15fe2596cf672", "width": 2560}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1520610713, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3645, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ujf1P2jv36L6D8oEoMcjkpAfLfRRY1GGW4GZ7ptnSO8.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "[humor] LIGHTING IS EVERYTHING!

I read somewhere that it is very high in silicones which is something that breaks me out. Is this true?\n\nAnd if so what's a silicone free sunscreen for sensitive skin I can use that leaves a minimal white cast? I was using a neutrogina sunscreen for sensitive skin before and it didn't do this to me but it did make a coworker ask if I was sick due to how pale I looked.
