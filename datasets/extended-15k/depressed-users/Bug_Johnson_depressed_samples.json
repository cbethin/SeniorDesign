We started dating 4 years ago in college when she was a freshman and I was a sophomore. She lives 110 miles away from me, which means summers were long-distance. Now she's graduated but still at (her parents') home and I'm finishing up my last class at my own (parents') home.\n\nInitially, things were fun and new and exciting, but after a while she explained to me that her school didn't have a Family Life/Sex Ed beyond \"SEX IS BAD\" and despite having no religious upbringing she is still to this day absolutely terrified of sex. She thinks it will be the most horrible pain imaginable and get her pregnant even if we use a condom + Birth control, which she has been on for about 3 years now. To this day we have never had sexual intercourse. She's equally horrified by the idea of oral sex, and on only one single occasion has she ever consented to me going down on her. That was over a year ago. Otherwise it's the same blank-faced emotionless handjob that she obviously hates doing. I try to get into it but there's never anything to work with and most the time I have to think back to porn I've seen in order to climax before it drags on too long and her arm gets sore.\n\nI know that the above portion may seem out of place for r/depression but I feel like this scenario is eroding me away from within. It makes me feel impotent and worthless to know that there is nothing I can do or say that could convince the woman who loves me that sex with me could be more enjoyable than being mauled by wild dogs. When I'm at work or in a group and the conversation turns to sex, I start frantically searching for some unrelated distraction so that I escape any questioning because I know that I can't explain my state to them. They wouldn't believe me if I did.\n\nI don't know if I should break up with her or not. Aside from matters of sex, she's the only person I can even begin to trust with anything emotional, but when it comes to mental health she's as much of a mess as I am, and I'd rather help her with her own issues than foist mine onto her. But at the same time, I feel trapped. I can't meet anyone else because I'm already in a relationship, but if the reason I leave her is because she won't have sex with me, I can probably kiss any sort of positive interaction with anyone I've met in the past 4 years goodbye. I know this board doesn't like mentions of suicide, so let's call it \"social doing-a-death-to-oneself\".\n\nI have no one left to turn to but strangers online. A couple of months ago I told her that I want to have had sex by the end of the year, or I don't know if I'll be able to stay with her anymore. I don't know if she took me seriously or not, or if she's just hoping I'll forget. I worry that I'm throwing my life away for someone who loves me but refuses to expend any energy in showing it.\n\nI can't imagine anyone else has been in this same spot, nor do I expect anyone to extend me their sympathies. Just a cursory look at this board and I can see that many users here would give an arm and a leg just to have one person to call their own. But I am reaching my limit. Most of the time, I find myself trying to ward of thoughts of her because I know they will only ever end how they always have: with feelings of disappointment, rejection, and a dead-eyed, emotionless handjob.\n\nThank you for your time.

You become huge, gain 136 temp HP, and two very strong melee attacks which deal an average of 33 and 20 damage. There are worse things that one can be in a fight than a T-Rex. However, it has been my experience that most groups aren\u2019t thrilled on seeing this used in every combat, or for that matter any combat. While the thematic scope of D&amp;D has always been vast, including medieval fantasy, gothic horror, and even sci-fi alien crash sites in *Expedition to the Barrier Peaks*, the T-Rex still has trouble fitting in. The biggest dilemma is determining how the caster knows that dinosaurs exist. Perhaps the Wizard learns about them in an archaeology textbook in some library (incidentally, this would make a fantastic quest for a Transmuter seeking the ultimate form), or perhaps the setting is one like Eberron where dinosaurs are not entirely extinct but are confined to one territory. Perhaps your characters are cavemen fighting for survival.\n\nRegardless of the explanation, the sudden interjection of a Huge dinosaur can be very disruptive in a game. In almost any fight involving a T-Rex and any number of smaller creatures, the T-rex is the most important combatant. This can force the DM to either a) design combat encounters that use extreme range or other gimmicks to invalidate the T-Rex\u2019s presence, or b) focus all enemies on the T-Rex, zerging it down as quickly as possible. Now, these are things that will vary depending on who you\u2019re playing with. You may be the group that plays as Ug, Squog, and Gugg and Gugg just hit level 7 and he\u2019s ready for some sweet revenge on those dinos. But these are things to keep in mind. \n\nFurthermore, the T-rex is __not__ the insta-win that many profess it to be. This is a much bigger problem for Wizards and the like than it is for Druids, but maintaining concentration against multiple attacks per round is not as easy as it seems. Even with the Warcaster feat, don\u2019t expect to last more than a few rounds unless you have allies who are ready and able to take out multiple attackers each round. Your pitiful 13 AC (15 wth Mage Armor if your DM allows it; they won\u2019t) is about as useful as fighting in the nude, and your Huge size makes you susceptible to up to 16 melee attacks if surrounded, more if any of them have reach weapons. Not to mention that if your enemies are out of range *you* are out of luck. Finally, as a T-Rex, all of your damage is limited to two targets per round, so think twice before charging headfirst into that kobold phalanx.\n\n\n\n__So now onto the spell itself:__\n\nBefore learning this spell or casting it, ask yourself this one question: __could I beat this creature in a 1v1 fight? Is this *animal* more dangerous than a 7th level spellcaster?__ Again, except for the T Rex, the answer will almost always be 'yes'. Being limited to beasts is a gigantic drawback. It essentially makes this spell not worth one's time. Unless you want to turn into a T Rex, your options are restricted to things like apes, lions and bears which, by the time you\u2019re 7th level and can cast polymorph, have become entirely irrelevant in any combat. These beasts all have drastically fewer hit points than the T-rex, and none come close to the T-rex\u2019s damage output. 5e's polymorph spell simply lacks any combat value outside of the T-Rex- again, a cheesy strategy that most DMs and most players don't want at their tables.\n\n\n\n__What about polymorphing to gain a swim speed?__\n\nSo is there any reason to cast this spell? Well, you could use it situationally as a means of gaining a fly or swim speed. Perhaps you need to explore a dangerous underwater dungeon, so you polymorph into a tiger shark. Now you have a swim speed, gills, and a nice bite attack, as well as pack tactics. Sounds like a decent proposition, right? Well remember that there is another handy spell called Water Breathing which grants the benefit of gills and, more importantly, allows you to cast spells with verbal components underwater. Plus, if you have anyone else in your group who requires oxygen, a single cast of Water Breathing can affect up to 10 creatures simultaneously, lasts 8 hours and best of all, WATER BREATHING DOES NOT REQUIRE CONCENTRATION. This spell can even be cast as a ritual, for goodness sake! Simply put, Water Breathing is a top tier spell, and worth taking in any game that isn't set on the Elemental Plane of Fire.\n\n\n\n__What about polymorphing to gain a fly speed?__ \n\nThe ability to transform into a hawk or owl has considerable stealth and surveillance opportunities. But once again, another spell outclasses Polymorph: Fly. While the Fly spell in 5e in no way compares to its 3rd edition iteration, it still constitutes a superior inclusion in a PC\u2019s spell list over Polymorph. As is always the case with Polymorph, you give up your spell casting ability, further limiting what you can do upon reaching whatever destination you are flying to. Mind you, this is at the cost of a 4th level spell slot *and* your precious concentration. While the Fly spell does require your concentration and lasts only 1/6th of the duration that Polymorph does (10min vs 1hr), it still allows you to cast plenty of offensive and defensive spells like Lightning Bolt, Shield, Counterspell, and Shatter, as well as almost any cantrip. These spells don\u2019t require concentration and can be used to targets on the ground while staying out of harm\u2019s way, or against other aerial foes, both at equal effectiveness. This means that Polymorph is only the better option than Fly when avoiding detection is the top priority and the distance to fly is longer than what can be achieved in the 10 minute duration of the Fly spell.\n\n\n\n__What about turning into other people?__ \n\nThis leaves one remaining possible usage of polymorph: deception. There are plenty of other spells designed for the purposes of deception, all of which are of lower level than polymorph. The most basic is Disguise Self, which at the cost of a 1st level spell slot lets you customize your outward appearance however you like, so long as you remain roughly the same size and don't try to sprout any extra appendages. The illusion is thin, and close inspection or physical contact can disrupt it, but in most cases it will get the job done. For those times when Disguise Self just doesn\u2019t cut it, you have Alter Self. This 2nd level spell has three options which can independently achieve anything that one might attempt with Polymorph. You want deception? You can customize your appearance and continue to change it so long g as you maintain concentration. You botched your charisma check and now you're in combat? Drop the disguise act and now you have claws! Did your cleric roll a natural 1 against a Wererat's bite? Switch into the aquatic adaptation and swim the sewer currents to safety. The only limit of these spells is that they can only be cast with a range of 'self'. Aside from that, these options are vastly superior to Polymorph in the described scenarios, both for their low slot level cost and their versatility.\n\n\n\n__So is there anytime you should take Polymorph?__\n\nDespite its seemingly infinite shortcomings, Polymorph has one thing that all of these other spells do not: versatility. While its not the best option any time, Polymorph is *an* option *every* time. Specifically, if you\u2019re playing a Sorcerer, and you can\u2019t justify learning all four of the spells listed above, Polymorph is a spell that can be used to mimic any of there effects, albeit to a lesser degree.\n\nSo those are my thoughts on Polymorph. As I see it, this spell is a trap more than anything else, and simply not worth adding to your spell list. Thankfully the higher level version, True Polymorph, is a much more useful and interesting spell, and one that I will take at any opportunity I am given. If you think that Polymorph isn't so bad, I would love to hear your reasons why in the comments below.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dndnext", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vbgl", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Polymorph is a Terrible Spell", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/7x36ql/polymorph_is_a_terrible_spell/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Bug_Johnson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1513032270, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofFailures/comments/7j624s/new_subterranean_cameras_show_us_the_first/", "id": "7j624s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/LeagueofFailures/comments/7j624s/new_subterranean_cameras_show_us_the_first/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "gyr004phHRM1yUjuDxl7YeMQg06b_1X_J_IJaQcZkDs", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/iZ_LNMa0bJeg4NRJkjFH_4T_oidMc9edq8nkY8u44ak.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=65b5096e0e506e3684a3ecd041efbd3f", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/iZ_LNMa0bJeg4NRJkjFH_4T_oidMc9edq8nkY8u44ak.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=e06d7863b8c1939e542eeb642f8d628f", "width": 216}, {"height": 179, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/iZ_LNMa0bJeg4NRJkjFH_4T_oidMc9edq8nkY8u44ak.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a31cc9cf4455939e47c776dc89d89053", "width": 320}, {"height": 359, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/iZ_LNMa0bJeg4NRJkjFH_4T_oidMc9edq8nkY8u44ak.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=7ccc0855cb23415cb3c6c2eac406d171", "width": 640}, {"height": 539, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/iZ_LNMa0bJeg4NRJkjFH_4T_oidMc9edq8nkY8u44ak.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=a3c06f4bd4e38b6b7b6c8316a367e895", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/iZ_LNMa0bJeg4NRJkjFH_4T_oidMc9edq8nkY8u44ak.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=9a9a56ddcf2e3a0b30ef4315ea62fae5", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 768, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/iZ_LNMa0bJeg4NRJkjFH_4T_oidMc9edq8nkY8u44ak.png?s=22a4240d4f0c40fcfbae8995cdb0ca1f", "width": 1366}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1513094258, "score": 2, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LeagueofFailures", "subreddit_id": "t5_3izie", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ihOhrdowZvX36c0toKlq3dK_xRfXsceLYCMz4iXEF1k.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 78, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "New subterranean cameras show us the first full-color image of Hell.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/2ljz7dpyfd301.png", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Bug_Johnson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1506793889, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/73gcx2/how_do_you_make_a_5_year_plan/", "id": "73gcx2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/73gcx2/how_do_you_make_a_5_year_plan/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1506887573, "score": 1, "selftext": "My dad is forcing me to create some sort of 5 year plan for my future.

I'm double majoring in Theatre, but despite my dad's attempts at lying it's more than obvious that a career in the arts is not good enough by his standards.\n\ntl;dr: How do I plan for the next 5 years when I have no realistic goals or things I'd like to achieve?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you make a 5 year plan?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/73gcx2/how_do_you_make_a_5_year_plan/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Bug_Johnson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503963738, "domain": "youtube.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sheetmusic/comments/6wndv6/r_looking_for_girl_can_i_kiss_you_with_tongue/", "id": "6wndv6", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "requests", "link_flair_text": "Requests", "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "52fredfan", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/52fredfan", "height": 344, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HDK7Ejnylw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "provider_name": "YouTube", "provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "thumbnail_height": 360, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HDK7Ejnylw/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 480, "title": "12 Girl, Can I Kiss You With Tounge Cry-Baby Musical", "type": "video", "version": "1.0", "width": 459}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HDK7Ejnylw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "height": 344, "scrolling": false, "width": 459}, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/sheetmusic/comments/6wndv6/r_looking_for_girl_can_i_kiss_you_with_tongue/", "retrieved_on": 1504046526, "score": 1, "secure_media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "52fredfan", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/52fredfan", "height": 344, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HDK7Ejnylw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "provider_name": "YouTube", "provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "thumbnail_height": 360, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HDK7Ejnylw/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 480, "title": "12 Girl, Can I Kiss You With Tounge Cry-Baby Musical", "type": "video", "version": "1.0", "width": 459}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HDK7Ejnylw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "height": 344, "scrolling": false, "width": 459}, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "sheetmusic", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qktf", "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 105, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "[R] Looking for \"Girl, Can I Kiss You With Tongue?\" from \"Cry-Baby: the Musical\"", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HDK7Ejnylw"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Bug_Johnson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1502522600, "domain": "self.DnD", "edited": 1502523039, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6t75v3/steal_this_build_bladereaver_of_levistus/", "id": "6t75v3", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "5e", "link_flair_text": "5th Edition", "locked": false, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DnD/comments/6t75v3/steal_this_build_bladereaver_of_levistus/", "retrieved_on": 1502624403, "score": 2, "selftext": "This build is for an NPC i plan to feature in an upcoming game. The character is a worshiper of the Levistus, Lord of the 5th. She will try to work her way into the party and travel with them, pretending to be just a rogue on her own quest who can team up with them. \n\n\"Stabby McBackstaber\"\nAC: 17 (Studded Leather)\nHP: 47\nStr 8, Dex 20, Con 8, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 14\nCharlatan Background\n\nLightfoot Halfling\n*+2 Dex, +1 Cha\n***L u c k y**\n*Advantage on Fear saves\n*Moving through the squares of anything larger than you (**enemies**)\n*Able to hide in a larger ally's space.\n\n**Rogue (Arcane Trickster)**\n*Sneak Attack - So long as you have advantage or the target is standing next to someone hostile to it, you get 3d6 bonus damage on one attack per round. \n*Expertise (Sleight of Hand, Deception)\n*Cunning Action - Excellent range of options and mobility in combat. Disengage especially, as this character is rather frail.\n*Enchantment and Illusion spells (Arcane Trickster)\n*Mage Hand Ledgermain- The Force, but you can pick locks and defuse bombs with it. And it's a bonus action no less.(Arcane Trickster)\n**Uncanny Dodge** This feature is what lets you get away with having 47 max HP at level 11. As a reaction, you can choose to take half damage from any single instance of damage. No rolling necessary.\n\n**Cleric (Trickery Domain)**\n\n*Blessing of the Trickster - give an ally advantage on Stealth checks for an hour. Infinite uses.\n\n*Channel Divinity (2/rest)\n\nDestroy Undead - Eh. It's nice when you need it.\nInvoke Duplicity - Clone yourself and get Sneak Atttack off consistently. This can also be used to set an ambush with, as you still get Sneak Attack because the target is engaged with someone who isn't \"you\". Duration is concentration up to 1 min.\nCloak of Shadows - Turn invisible until the end of your next turn. Attacking and spellcasting break it early, so this will probably only be *useful* is when dashing away from an enemy.\n\n**Spells**\n*The important ones:*\n*Mage Hand\n*Charm Person\n*Color Spray\n*Disguise Self\n*Mirror Image\n*Pass Without Trace\n*Blink\n*Dispel Magic\n\nAnd because you are a multiclass of a full casting class and a 1/3 casting class, your effective caster level (7) grants you access to a single level 4 spell slot on the cleric Spell List. Since Clerics know all of their spells for any level they can cast, this means having access to the following options:\n***Death Ward*** - For the next 8 hours you have 1UP. Absolutely invaluable when it comes to surviving a critical hit.\n***Banishment*** - A spell with all sorts of potential uses. In order to make it permanent, you have to concentrate for the maximum 1 min duration, and an unwilling target gets a Charisma save to negate the attack.\n\n**Feat**\n*Stealthy (UA)* - +1 DEX, Profeciency with Stealth, and you can move up to 10 ft while remaining hidden, so long as you end your move in a square where you can take the Hide action.\n\nI'd love to know what other people think of this build. I plan on having the character interact with the PCs for a while, rather than just being a single boss monster encounter. With so many ways to get out of trouble, I think there will be a lot of potential for this character to make it through a fight unscathed because she turned invisible, and dashed to cover, where she hid until the end of the chaos.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DnD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r9ei", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Steal this Build! - Bladereaver of Levistus [5e][Character build]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6t75v3/steal_this_build_bladereaver_of_levistus/", "view_count": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Bug_Johnson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1489426085, "domain": "self.dndnext", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/5z6c90/5eis_there_anything_stronger_than_a_pc/", "id": "5z6c90", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/dndnext/comments/5z6c90/5eis_there_anything_stronger_than_a_pc/", "retrieved_on": 1492406283, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm beginning to think that in 5th edition, there is nothing stronger than player stats.
