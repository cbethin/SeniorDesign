I have a shuttle that takes me to Pentagon City on weekdays, so commuting time isn't a problem, but it's a pain to have to take the metro and then bus whenever else I want to get into DC.

Especially considering my friends live in Adams Morgan/NW DC and seldom come out far enough to visit me. \n\nAnother main factor is my car. I only pay $25/month for parking at my current place (it was free the previous year). A few months ago I was leaning towards selling my car and moving into DC, but after thinking about it a bit more, I love the freedom of having a car and being able to go off places on weekends, drive to the stores, etc. It's not something I want to give up. In an ideal world, I would move into DC AND have a place to park, but that it itself is a paradox. I don't want to spend over $1,200 a year to keep my gar in a garage. **With that being said, how viable is street parking in, say, Dupont Circle area? Will I quickly regret having a car there?

Anyway, I am just very frustrated and have been for quite some time now over the fact that I have great first dates and then things just fall off after. The juxtaposition between having first dates where women are very into me and them being very distant afterwards is just striking and infuriating. I know many women like to take things slower when it comes to dating due to very reasonable fears about overaggressive men, etc., but it still bewilders me. Some context:\n\nIn the past even six months, I've had probably 5-6 dates with women where I just felt ecstatic during and after our first date. We would kiss, maybe even hold hands, and just generally be close, have conversation that lasts for hours, etc. On Sunday, I went on a date (we had previously been talking on Twitter on and off for a few weeks) and we talked nonstop, had great chemistry, and at the end of the night when I was walking her home, she not only put her head on my shoulder and locked our arms when walking, but she kissed me goodnight. I understand now that previous dates may have just gone along with kissing because women rightfully probably worry about rejecting men's advances, but for this date, she clearly expressed strong interest at the end. She even texted me after thanking me for a great night and apologizing/being embarrassed for kissing me. But, in the last 48 hours or so, she cancelled on plans (last minute doctor's appointment) without offering a date to reschedule, she has left me on Read via text 2-3 times, and she just has been very brief in her texts. \n\nThis is getting rather long, but I know I've had a habit of coming on too strong with women and I've tried my best (and will probably go into therapy soon to work on that) to work on it, but in situations like last night, I just can't fathom what would make someone so interested (and who made the first moves) and then 48 hours later, not at all. And for this to have happened 5-6 times to me in the last six months alone.......I just can't comprehend it. And it leaves me feeling hopeless when it comes to dating because I put my best foot forward, women respond extremely positively to me and the first date, but then it always dies pretty shortly after.

I have been skinny all my life and it has definitely had an impact on my self-confidence over the years. And I'm tired of being that way. I don't want to grow up skinny where people think they have the upper-hand on me. Being a skinny guy isn't fun -- other guys look down on you and ridicule you. I'm no longer as skinny as I used to be, but I still have pretty small arms and it makes doing things like wearing a lot of sizes of short-sleeve shirts to be uncomfortable and humiliating. I want to have confidence and I want to look good and have size. \n\nEvery few months I get inspired to start lifting and then I do it for a span of a couple of months, but usually I fall off the wagon and start making excuses + don't notice enough of a physical change and get discouraged. I want that to end and I want this time to be different. I want to look back a year or two from now and be a new person. Anyways, I think my problem before was simply that I didn't eat enough and wasn't putting on weight. I only started last Wednesday, but I've been tracking everything I eat pretty meticulously. \n\nI am making this post so I can get some general tips, advice, support, etc. to make sure I am not doing anything wrong + to add any suggestions that are useful. **Below is some of my basic information:**\n\n**Height: 5'8\"**\n\n**Current weight: 141-142** \n\n**Goal weight: 155 or so, in around 3-4 months, so a little less than 1 lb a week**\n\n**BMI: 20.8%**\n\n**BMR: 1650**\n\n**TDEE: 2557**\n\n**Here is the current workout I'm doing:** r/https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/complete-mf-beginners-training-guide-plan\n\n**Here is my usual/daily meal plan:**\n\n*Breakfast:*\n\n\\-Eggs + toast/egg mcmuffin + some kind of fruit, or parfait (granola, nonfat Greek yogurt, banana/fruit)\n\n*Lunch/dinner:*\n\n\\-Chicken +rice + veggies\n\n*Snacks:*\n\n\\-four scoops of muscle milk (590 calories, 40 g protein)\n\n\\-Peanut butter + apples\n\n\\-Nuts assortments\n\n\\-Hummus + pita chips\n\nOccasionally, I'll eat bad food like pizza or McDonalds, but 80% of my meals or so are clean and healthy. All in all, I am consuming about **2,500 -- 2,800 calories a day and going to the gym to lift weights 3-4 times a week.**\n\nSo, with all this information (sorry for the overload), am I doing things right? Should I be consuming that amount of calories? Is my BMI too high/too low? Will I start noticing a difference anytime soon? Is the workout I linked to above a good one? I moved to a new city a while back and have always been intimidated by the gym + I go alone, so I feel lost in the wilderness sometimes on this topic. I truly don't know if I'm doing things right and could use a lot of advice.

I am there for her all the time -- around the clock -- and have been for years. She's a kind person who has had a tough family life and has major attachment issues, so I empathize with her, but at this point, all the negativity and drama is starting to stress me out and darken my moods. I am blunt with her and honest and tell her that I am not her therapist and that she needs to be proactive/stop feeling sorry for herself and take steps to not be bothered by such small things, but it apparently has no impact.\n\nI am unemployed right now so it's not like it's taking a toll on anything else, but it feels like I am on call, 24/7, expected to pick up the phone or answer long texts. Tearful, hours long phone calls about very, very minor things and dramas that all of us deal with on a daily basis. Boy issues, drama with friends -- stuff a 23/24 year old should be able to handle. Things that make the rest of us bummed for a few hours. From dawn to dusk she will text me about some minor misunderstanding or boy drama. Hours spent trying to craft a text to send to a boy. I have told her repeatedly I am not her therapist and she is not helpless, has her own agency (and needs to see a therapist), but at this point I just can't handle it anymore. I would never allow myself to be rude enough to say, ignore her. But, at this point I dread her texts and phone calls. \n\nWhat do I do?

That's what I play Fallout for -- the rich history, factions, quests, emotional resonance, etc. But, I thought to myself, \"If I can find a community of people to play with that won't kill me on the spot, who want to actually play the game and build and be in peace.....it could be fun.\" So, how about we organize some committed-to-peace groups in here?

The Unsullied took Casterly Rock, but it's clear that they are in a less than ideal situation and their fleet has been destroyed. Suffice to say, Tyrion's \"Divide and Conquer\" strategy of getting to the Iron Throne isn't working. When one recalls the conversation Daenerys and Olenna had about ignoring the advice of others and just going full-on dragon, I think it points to Daenerys saying enough is enough and unleashing her dragons and the Dothraki. She will win this war eventually and the Iron Throne will be hers, but when all is said and done, she will rule over ashes -- which would literally be like the vision she saw in Qarth of the throne room.\n\nMaybe this would be a radical change of her personality, but I think that the show is starting to allude to the fact that maybe she isn't so different than the Mad King. Between her \"I will burn you alive\" comment to Varys and her massive ego/entitlement in her conversation with Jon tonight.......I think it all adds up to her possibly  becoming morally corrupted. \n\nGRRM has said the ending of GOT will be bittersweet and while I don't know what Dany's role will be in regards to the White Walkers, I think she will win the Iron Throne, but it will be a Pyrrhic Victory and she will be Queen of the ashes.", "spoiler": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjz2", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "[EVERYTHING] Prediction: Daenerys is going to become the Mad Queen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6qlvds/everything_prediction_daenerys_is_going_to_become/", "view_count": null}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "GoHuskies858", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1500228808, "domain": "self.jobs", "edited": 1500229536, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6nno62/tips_for_a_onepage_writing_sample/", "id": "6nno62", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/6nno62/tips_for_a_onepage_writing_sample/", "retrieved_on": 1502110094, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm applying for an internship in a Senator's office in Washington DC and the application requires a one-page writing sample.

I'll try not to go on a rambling description of my entire life and obviously it's hard to truly give me advice without knowing every detail about my life, but I'll try my best.\n\nSo, I'm a 22 year old living in Seattle (graduated from college a year ago) and for the past year, I've been doing social media for a company. It pays well ($45-50k), especially given my rent in a big house ($605/month) and the benefits are good (matching 401k, 15 days of PTO), but there's no room for upwards growth or promotion. At this point, I'm just wasting time in the job.\n\nIn addition, I've been very burnt out lately. I've lived in Seattle for five years and think it's an amazing place, but a lot of my close friends have left and I no longer have any meaningful relationships here. In addition, I think life is too short to not live in a bunch of different cities when you're young and I've always wanted to move to the East Coast, specifically DC. My true passion is politics and while I don't know exactly how I'm going to get into politics, I know that being around politics is what I want. \n\nI've been applying for jobs for like 5-6 months and have had a bunch of different interviews (even flew out to DC to interview for a major company in VA), but to no avail. My rent ends August 31, and as of now, I'm planning to quit my current job and move across the country to DC.\n\nThis is where all of your advice comes in. I've saved up a good amount of money (over $20,000) thanks to being born in privilege and having parents pay for my college. I'm very thankful for that, but I'm also very thrifty and not reckless with my money.  But, it does provide me the opportunity to move across the country without a job yet and not have to worry about being homeless. Plus, I can live with a relative for a month or two in Northern Virginia. \n\nSo, I'm asking for any tips all of you might have. I'm not naive and I've thought almost everything through, but it's still a big risk in life. I've thought about the financial situation, cost of rent in DC, the prospect of not finding a job, etc. \n\nAm I missing anything? Have you done something similar in your life?

I've always wanted to move to DC and I've been in Seattle for five years and feel like my life is in a rut and that I'm no longer happy here.

I am far from a naive person, but I do worry I'm taking a major risk in my life by potentially leaving a great job just because I may not be as happy lately.

I've been to Boston, NYC, Pittsburgh and really love the East Coast, but never DC. I moved to Seattle from San Diego on my own for college and studied abroad on my own in Dublin, so I'm certainly not new to change or living in a new city.

I really appreciate you all taking the time to read this.

The other part of me says I want to be involved in politics or at least around politics, and that I've always wanted to go to DC. Life is worth taking chances and I'll always regret not moving.

There is never any blood in the toilet or on the stool itself, but usually on the final wipes, there is a small amount of bright red blood (sometimes orange/pink ish). I've had one or two BMs where you could really see the blood on a wipe and there was a good amount, but usually it is just a few dots and lines of blood on the tissue. It's sometimes accompanied by stinging, itching, burning in the anal region afterwards, but it is never painful DURING A BM. \n\nMy questions are, for you shit experts, is, should I be worried? Obviously, at the end of the day, the doctor knows best, but is it common to have INTERNAL hemmorhoids (which the doc said it was possible) and have small amounts of bleeding in 75-80% of BM?

My planning is only in its infant stage, as I'm just interested and not seriously looking into it yet, but I really want to visit Japan.\n\nAnyways, my questions might be vague, but I'm just looking to get a feel for what it would be like and figured this is the best place to ask!\n\nMy best bet is driving up to Vancouver from Seattle and flying straight to Toyko (only around $650 round trip), so flight's aren't really an issue. But, here are some questions:\n\n1. What would the experience be like for a 21 year old, white male in Tokyo? Is the nightlife good? Bars? Clubs? Alcohol? I'm a respectful and very self-aware person (not a loud American and make a serious effort to blend in/speak the native language), so take into account I won't be obnoxious haha.\n\n2. Where should I stay/what is the best way to get around without breaking the bank? My budget is a bit higher now with my job, but I'm still looking to keep it as relatively cheap as possible. \n\n3. How long should I stay? What else is there outside of Tokyo to see and how accessible is it? What are the best must-see sights in Tokyo and Japan as a whole? I love natural beauty and architectural wonders (Rome has been my favorite city I've traveled to, but I also loved London). Is Tokyo right for this?\n\n4. What customs should I observe/that are different from America? (Done some basic research on issues like tipping, bowing, not being loud in public, etc.)\n\n5. Any other various tips, ideas, etc. are more than appreciated. A lot of the above questions are pretty vague, but I'm just trying to get a feel for what it would be like and whether I will have a good time in Japan (I do tend to make the most of my opportunities).

On both FO3 and FNV, especially FNV, I played multiple playthrough's. I think part of the reason for that was that FNV had so many different, significant factions and it completely changed how you played the game and how others reacted to you. In FO4, it just doesn't seem like the factions play THAT much of a role, as you only really have to commit to one near the end. By that point, the significance of choosing a faction seems kinda irrelevant for the most part.\n\nBecause of this, I'm having a tough time wanting to start a new character. I feel like the main storyline will be played almost exactly the same. Granted, I've only played a little over two days and have many places to explore, but I guess the novelty of finding locations and small quests has worn off because it doesn't feel at all relevant to the larger story. I guess you could apply all of these criticisms to FO3, which was arguably far narrower in the main campaign than FO4, but nevertheless, I'm having a tough time starting again.\n\nAm I right?

All in all decently healthy. Been exercising lately and diet isn't bad.\n\nFor the 6-8 weeks I've had abdominal issues. I have a history of IBS and hemorrhoids, but this has been different. \n\nIt started about eight weeks ago with like mid-abdomen cramping, nothing too bad. I had a lot more gas at night and it was uncomfortable to sit, but other than that, nothing too bad. \n\nFor the past four weeks, the pain/discomfort has remained mild, but it has migrated more so towards the upper abdomen (doctor told me during an abdomen inspection that he thought my liver and spleen were inflamed and could be mono/Epstein-Barr). So, for the past few weeks, the discomfort comes in the form of tightness and pressure right under the right rib cage and a little lower under the left rib cage. During the day, it is fine and not too noticeable, just feels like mild tightness under the ribs. At night, it is the worst because it is uncomfortable to lie on either of my sides, as it feels as if I'm lying on something. Not painful, but just uncomfortable and keeps me from falling asleep. The most comfortable position is on my back. Anyways, I'll try to sum this all up below because I'm making a jumble out of this\n\n\n\nSymptoms:\n\n-Been going on for 6-8 weeks; pain/discomfort has remained mostly mild, tight, feels like cramping. Very infrequent mild sharp pains. \n\n-Started as just discomfort in lower abdomen (I assumed it was intestinal and IBS due to stress) with a lot of gas at night.\n\n-However, slowly migrated towards upper abdomen. Still accompanied by frequent gas at times, but the most frequent issue is just mild tightness in the area of my spleen and liver. This discomfort has remained in this area for the past 2-3 weeks with the same level of discomfort. Not getting better or worse. Some days slightly better or worse than others.\n\n-Bowel movements normal, no fatigue, may have increased thirst and itching, however. Stress.\n\n-Hard to sleep at night on sides (due to inflammation?). Back sore/hurts.\n\n-Likely made worse by stress.\n\n-Blood work came out FINE, no abnormalities, still waiting on Epstein-Barr test.\n\n-Made worse by alcohol (pain in liver, which makes sense).\n\n\n\n\n*If somehow you can decode all this and give an insightful answer, you have some serious medical knowledge lol. The blood test results came out clean (still waiting on Epstein-Barr) and other than a one-day fever I had that quickly went away, I haven't had any other symptoms other than upper abdominal discomfort and now some slight back pain. Granted, I'm likely a hypochondriac, but I've never experienced anything like this before, and while the pain is mild, it is worrisome when you have prolonged issues near so many vital organs. With a clean blood test, should I still be worried or can I breath a sigh of relief?

Since then, I haven't had any major IBS incidences, just minor stuff like upset stomach every now and then and blood on toilet issue (which could be something of a concern based on the information below). I think it is likely from a fissure or hemorrhoids, but anyways...\n\nI have been having some abdominal issues and obviously it is difficult to answer this question without tests or knowing my full medical history, but I'll try to describe my situation.\n\nI have been under stress the past month or so and about three weeks ago I started experiencing some abdominal discomfort. Nothing too painful, but it was hard to fall asleep at night because of discomfort on both my left and right sides, as if my intestines were inflamed. Most of the day I wouldn't notice it and would be fine, but at other times I would experience cramping/sharp (but mild) pain in either my right or left side (lower abdomen). Pain has never been bad, mostly mild, and has been solely on the right side about 70% and both on the left and right side the other 30% of the time.\n\nMy bowel movements are normal but I had diarrhea one or two days (may have been from alcohol consumption and sugar the night before) and one day my stool was green (could have been from consuming too many vitamins on accident), but other than that, my stools have been normal, frequency has been the same, but just with more gas. \n\nThis may be confusing, but do you think this is something I should worry about? I tend to be paranoid when it comes to health things and I have figured I have IBS for years, but I haven't had these symptoms before, even if it isn't severe, just mildly annoying. Should I start worrying now or wait and see what happens and if he doesn't go away?\n\ntl;dr have for a year or so had minor blood on the tissue (sometimes not for months, sometimes a few times a week) while going to the bathroom. I think it is likely just hemorrhoids or a fissure, but the recent onset of mild uncomfortableness in my abdomen has me worried it could be something worse, like colon cancer.\n\nThanks so much.

The Canon Rebel XSi appears to be a mid-range camera -- not too nice, but not too cheap either. So, with the right settings, skills, and lenses, I should be able to produce relatively impressive photos. \n\ntl;dr I could use some advice on what lenses, settings to use.

Preller would be TRIPLING down on this roster if he decides he doesn't want to sell. \n\nSelling looks bad, no doubt. It is reducing the hope of every Padre fan that got excited this off-season and is a huge slap in the face to every fan who thought this season and this management was different. BUT, it is the smartest thing to do. Preller must not let ego and his fear of being embarrassed by his failure in 2015 let him make another critical mistake and hold onto this team -- this losing team. This season is done, so you might as well start from scratch, rebuild the farm system, and try again next off-season, but with a rebuilt farm system.\n\nYes, the farm system has been incredibly bad the last decade so plenty of people are going to be rightfully hesitant and say 'it hasn't worked trading proven talent for prospects, so don't do it'. But, it is the best move for the long-term, and heck, even the short-term based on the fact that this current 'short-term, win-now' roster is no better than the Padres scrub rosters of seasons past, at least when it comes to actually winning games.\n\ntl;dr Preller's biggest mistake, which would strongly suggest he is not right for this job, would be to hold onto this roster right now. It would be tripling down on the guys he acquired, who have proven through 96 games that they are no better than Padre teams of old, let alone a playoff team. It is time to sell (not a fire sale, but guys like Upton, Cashner, Benoit, Kennedy), acknowledge this season was  a failure, acquire some prospects, and try it again next off-season. Holding onto this roster or even ridiculously, buying, would be a colossal detriment to this team in the near future.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Padres", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s8d6", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "'Tis the season for selling", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Padres/comments/3eey7u/tis_the_season_for_selling/"}, {"author": "GoHuskies858", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1435799169, "domain": "self.Seattle", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/3btkgm/no_pay_for_work_training/", "id": "3btkgm", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 31, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Seattle/comments/3btkgm/no_pay_for_work_training/", "retrieved_on": 1440636642, "score": 13, "selftext": "Forgive me if this isn't relevant, but I felt it was the closest sub for my question.\n\nThe other day I had an interview for a bussing job at a restaurant in Seattle and the same day, in the evening I had a work 'study' with them.

Auction draft tonight.

Then, in the early/middle rounds go after one more very good pitcher, like Lester and another bat, someone like Dickerson, at around $45. Four players and around $120/$260 spent.\n\nI then wait a long time, nominate players I have no interest in like injury prone stars like Cargo, unproven players like Rizzo, etc., and wait until the rounds are dwindling and I have the most money. Based on my eight-team league and two mock drafts, I can fill out my rotation (needs five pitchers) with guys like James Shields, Jacob DeGrom, Tyson Ross, Samardzisidhfd all for $1-2 each. I also noted Kimbrel and Holland would go for $10-15 each, but I could wait and get Storen/Rosenthal/Robertson for like $3-4 total. \n\nIs this a strategy you employ? Stack up on an ace or two, buy mainly bats, and then pad your rotation at the very end with above-average/All-Stars, but not ace starters, for a few bucks?
