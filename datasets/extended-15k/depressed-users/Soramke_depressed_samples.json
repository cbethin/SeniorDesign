I took it every day until December, when I stopped taking it for winter break because I felt that I was becoming dependent on it and it was severely increasing my anxiety. Now, I only take it once a week or so, when I particularly need it to focus.\n\nI don't want to go into all the details of my personal life here, but just to give you the relevant background information, I'm very romantically inexperienced (haven't had a boyfriend since 9th grade) and haven't really pursued any sort of romantic relationship since starting college, but for the past month or so there's this guy I've been talking to, and we both like each other, and it's the strongest I've felt about anyone in years. Except that when I take Adderall, it seems to kill all my feelings for him. Like, all of a sudden I'm entirely uninterested in him romantically and his flirting annoys me. Which is pretty frustrating to me.\n\nI'm trying to figure out why Adderall might have this effect on me. After all, it increases dopamine, which is associated with love, isn't it? So you would think it would make me feel more strongly for him, not less. On the other hand, it also definitely increases my anxiety, and I already know that some of my anxiety both stems from and interferes with my romantic relationships, and makes it harder to feel positively about the source of said anxiety (that is, the object of my affections, the person I'm anxious about).\n\nHas anybody else experienced this or a similar issue on Adderall?

I was initially really upset about this, and posted about it a lot on my page on my school's own private social media site. A 31-year-old (at the time) alumnus of my school happened upon my post and let me know that he had been through a similar thing while he was there and invited me to text him if I needed support. I was feeling really alone and like I had nobody to talk to, so I did text him, and we wound up hitting it off and talking a lot.\n\nIt quickly became pretty clear that he had a crush on me, and after a while he admitted as much. I was resistant to any sort of romantic relationship with him at first, both because he's so much older than me and because I didn't want to have to worry about that while I was still trying to figure my own shit out, but I continued texting him a lot because I was stuck at home and lonely and didn't feel like I had anyone else to talk to. After a while, though, I did start to develop feelings for him, and I was pretty open with him about them (which made him very happy).\n\nThen in March, he basically had a psychotic break. Lots of paranoid delusions and stuff like that. It was really scary. He felt like everyone was out to get him and it seemed like I was the only one he would trust enough to talk to about what was going on. After Skypeing with him for most of a weekend and watching him get worse and worse, I managed to convince him to go to the ER. After that, he was on medication, and it got better for a while.\n\nUntil it got worse again. He wasn't having paranoid thoughts again (or definitely not to the same extent), but around mid or late May he started having extreme insomnia, which is still an ongoing problem. He decided to stop seeing his psychologist because he didn't feel like therapy was doing anything for him. He wanted to stop taking his medication because he hated the side effects. In early July he was extremely suicidal and would spend hours Skypeing with me just talking about how much he wanted to die and all the ways he could think of to kill himself. After a particularly bad day, when I was actually convinced he was going to kill himself if something didn't intervene or if I stopped Skypeing with him, I managed to convince him to go to the ER again, and he was admitted, but he left again after a few days and wasn't really any better. They had tried a bunch of different medication on him in the hospital, but nothing really helped his anxiety or made it possible for him to sleep for more than 3 or 4 hours a night. (Edited to clarify: He is still seeing his psychiatrist and taking what's prescribed to him, but they haven't found anything that will really help, and I think all he's on now is gabapentin as needed for anxiety.) We went straight back into our usual routine of Skypeing for hours every night while I listened to him talk about everything that was fucked up in his brain.\n\nThis has all been really stressful for me. I was supposed to use this semester off to work on my issues, but I feel like I haven't addressed any of my problems at all and have instead spent the whole time (hours-long conversations almost every day) talking to him about his problems. Now I'm going back to school in a week, and I know that I can't handle this on top of the stress of transitioning back into school. I finally talked to him last week about how stressed it was making me feel, and he promised he'd back off, stop talking to me so much about how he wanted to kill himself, etc. \n\nBut then in the past couple days it's gotten worse again. I'm housesitting for a family friend this weekend, and I was hoping that having a weekend away would give me some time to myself to relax, but I've wound up having to Skype with him for hours every night because he's been having a hard time. Last night he was freaking out, banging his head against the wall again and again while all I could do was sit there and listen and cry, talking about how he wanted to kill himself and looking up the dosages of various drugs he would need to do it, insisting that he must have some sort of brain damage, etc. And I just know I won't be able to handle something like that while I'm at school, and I know I can't trust things to be any different when I go back.\n\nSo I don't know what to do. I want to be there for him, and I sincerely care about him. I feel like I can't cut off all contact with him because I'd be losing one of my best friends, and I'm so, so worried that that would push him over the edge and cause him to kill himself (especially because he keeps saying I'm the best thing in his life, he doesn't know what he'd do without me, etc). But if I keep talking to him, I know things won't be any different, and I won't be able to set boundaries because I'll feel like I need to be there for him to keep things from getting even worse for him. He also expects us to meet up in person for the first time when I get back to school, because we'll only be 3 hours apart instead of halfway across the country from each other, but I honestly don't know if that's what I want to do anymore. I just feel so trapped, like there's no decision I can make here that could possibly work out well for either me or him.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR: Took a semester off to work on my issues, spent the whole time working on his issues instead, now going back to school. Don't feel like I can break things off without abandoning him (and possibly causing him to kill himself), but also feel like I can't continue things while trying to handle school again, so what can I do?**", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can't keep dealing with my [19F] kind-of boyfriend's [32M] mental illness and instability", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3h9mnv/cant_keep_dealing_with_my_19f_kindof_boyfriends/"}, {"author": "Soramke", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1440683413, "domain": "self.MakeupAddiction", "edited": 1440683924, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3iljtb/foundation_settling_in_pores_concealer_not/", "id": "3iljtb", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3iljtb/foundation_settling_in_pores_concealer_not/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "xvjBaQ1e69m5op8MIHhzgMi5i6r2SHkF15U0wJdrKfI", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Em0ttLNPc4iDF33Ytvx0F4CMrT3uHI1ovfL5J2TKMhI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=471a4f5de66b3bb8b0ff66f084ade8e9", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Em0ttLNPc4iDF33Ytvx0F4CMrT3uHI1ovfL5J2TKMhI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=bf903ee4cb6c3be56850354dece7c05c", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Em0ttLNPc4iDF33Ytvx0F4CMrT3uHI1ovfL5J2TKMhI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=27e9a03c785fd0177ba727e688590541", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Em0ttLNPc4iDF33Ytvx0F4CMrT3uHI1ovfL5J2TKMhI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=b02e556b1aae1721d07d0585873e7346", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Em0ttLNPc4iDF33Ytvx0F4CMrT3uHI1ovfL5J2TKMhI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=e8b9e2ad8e178fc3521fa0bc14aba443", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Em0ttLNPc4iDF33Ytvx0F4CMrT3uHI1ovfL5J2TKMhI.jpg?s=83c88c91b78fe455a21368b81d409bc4", "width": 960}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1443146122, "score": 3, "selftext": "[My dumb face](http://imgur.com/I9pccWv)\n\nSorry for the crap picture quality, but hopefully you can see my problem here.

I was on 18mg 2x/day for the first month, but that didn't feel like it was doing much, so my psychiatrist decided to increase the dose to 27mg 2x/day. For the first month, I got the Actavis generic. When I filled my new prescription for the higher dose, I wound up with the Mallinckrodt generic. I think the increased dose is good, but the effects aren't lasting nearly long enough, and even taking it twice a day, it still wears off too soon.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been reading up on Concerta generics, and found that the Mallinckrodt generic was [downgraded by the FDA](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm422568.htm) and is no longer an approved substitution for a Concerta prescription. Relevant excerpt:\n>As a result, the FDA has changed the therapeutic equivalence (TE) rating for the Mallinckrodt and Kudco products from AB to BX. This means the Mallinckrodt and Kudco products are still approved and can be prescribed, but are no longer recommended as automatically substitutable at the pharmacy (or by a pharmacist) for Concerta.\n\nI'm kind of pissed that they substituted my Concerta with something that the FDA has specifically said should not be substituted for it. Like, \"Your doctor wrote you this prescription for Concerta, and the FDA has said that this isn't actually equivalent to Concerta, but we're gonna give it to you anyways because fuck you.\" How is that legal?\n\nSo anyways, I'd really like to try the approved generic again (which is what I was already on last month; I just needed a higher dose). If that's not possible, I'd be willing to have my psychiatrist specify that I need the brand instead of the generic (I had to do that for Adderall, too), but I would rather avoid having to pay twice as much a month for it if possible. \n\nSo my question is, how can I go about possibly getting switched to the other generic? Would it be possible for me to print out that FDA report, show it to the pharmacist, be like \"Fuck you, why'd you give me this crap, give me the real shit instead\" (more diplomatically than that, of course) and have them switch me over right then? Or would I need to make another appointment with my psychiatrist and get another prescription first? I'd really rather not have to go through the rest of the month on something that isn't as effective as it should be, especially with the amount of pressure I'm under to keep doing well in school right now.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Switching Concerta generics -- Who do I go to?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3sea8k/switching_concerta_generics_who_do_i_go_to/"}, {"author": "Soramke", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1449713941, "domain": "self.NoStupidQuestions", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3w5u3t/should_an_opened_container_of_storebought/", "id": "3w5u3t", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "flair a", "link_flair_text": "Unanswered", "locked": false, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3w5u3t/should_an_opened_container_of_storebought/", "retrieved_on": 1454917198, "score": 1, "selftext": "A friend of mine used some store-bought canned vanilla frosting for a cake for her friend's birthday a few days ago, and then left the rest of the frosting sitting out until today, when she gave it to me because she doesn't have any use for it.

I took some of the advice given in that thread and went back to the more simple routine I had been using in the spring, but I haven't seen much improvement.\n\nNow, I've been thinking about what might have been the difference back in the spring, given that changes in my routine don't seem to be making a difference at all, and now that I've realized what the problem might be it seems so obvious, I don't know how I missed it. \n\nI had already had acne for years in high school, but it seems like it got significantly worse around August 2013, heading into my first semester of college. In fact, while I felt like shit about my skin for most of high school, looking back on pictures from the end of high school/summer before college now, I'm kind of amazed by how good my skin looks compared to how it looks now. I was diagnosed with ADHD in February of my senior year of high school (2013) and went on Adderall XR. I took it fairly consistently from summer 2013 until December 2014 (when I had already been on PocketDerm for a few months, with little in the way of results). \n\nAt that point, I took a semester off from school. I was at home with no psychiatrist to prescribe me my ADHD meds, and not as much reason to take them anyways because I didn't have any schoolwork to worry about, and what do you know, that semester is when my skin was starting to look a little better. Then it got notably worse again when I came back to school and started taking my meds again (Concerta this time, not Adderall XR). I think the Concerta is making it even worse than the Adderall did, although it's better for me in other ways.\n\nObviously none of this is proof that it's my meds that are causing my acne, but it does seem suspicious that my acne got much worse around the time I started taking them, got a little better when I wasn't taking them, and now is worse again.\n\nSo my question is: Assuming it's my medication that's causing this exacerbation of my acne, what are my options? I can't stop taking my medication. I need it to succeed in school (and I'm barely managing that as it is).

I already have pretty bad social anxiety and I always get the feeling that people are criticizing me behind my back, but it really hurts coming from the shift who's always given me the most constructive criticism and helped me the most.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "starbucks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qwza", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Vent] Bad day, feeling useless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/4sex74/vent_bad_day_feeling_useless/"}, {"author": "Soramke", "author_flair_css_class": "sbux", "author_flair_text": "Barista", "created_utc": 1472676544, "domain": "self.starbucks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/50jfkx/jacket_to_wear_in_dt/", "id": "50jfkx", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/starbucks/comments/50jfkx/jacket_to_wear_in_dt/", "retrieved_on": 1473097903, "score": 1, "selftext": "It's not a problem yet, as it's still in the 80s here, but I'm already dreading winter, as I live in the midwest US where it gets cold as fuck and I'm on DTR all the time.

My professor is asking about missing assignments that I had promised I'd get done by today but that I haven't been able to work on at all. I like and respect this professor a lot and this class is basically the most important class with regards to my career interests. This email may be oversharing, but I kind of need to share this with somebody and I want to assure my professor that I really do care about the class and I'm not just slacking off.\n\nHere's the email:\n\n\"I have diagnosed depression, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and trichotillomania. I always experience at least some low-level underlying depression at all times, but for the past couple of weeks I\u2019ve been in the middle of a more severe major depressive episode. One symptom of this episode has been extremely low energy. Given that this episode has coincided with, as you know, a major project in the exact area of study of this class, I\u2019ve kind of been forced to devote all of my very limited energy to that. I\u2019ve missed all of my scheduled shifts at work for the past two weeks because I\u2019ve been too anxious to go. I\u2019ve skipped all my classes except this one for the past two weeks for the same reason. I was recently prescribed an SSRI to try to control my anxiety. The last time I was on an SSRI 4 years ago, it made my depression so much worse that I failed all my classes that semester and led to failing out of my old school entirely, and I don\u2019t know yet if the same side effects are happening again.  I think about suicide multiple times every day (I mention that because it\u2019s a fact and it provides context about just how bad I\u2019m feeling lately, but please don\u2019t worry too much about it. I\u2019ve wished I was dead since I was maybe 10 years old, it\u2019s just the status quo, it doesn\u2019t mean anything). Uncle Vanya was the only positive thing in my life and now I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t unload all this on you, you\u2019re not my therapist (I don\u2019t have a therapist\u2026 probably a major oversight, hahaha). I don\u2019t want to make excuses and I wish I didn\u2019t have anything to make excuses for, but I just wanted to explain why I\u2019ve been so flaky. I just want you to know that I really care about this class and this subject and I promise I\u2019m trying.\"\n\nWell... even if this is too whiny to share with my professor, at least I can vent here?
