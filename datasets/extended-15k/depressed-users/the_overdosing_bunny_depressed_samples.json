I don\u2019t have a bad life, I have good friends and I\u2019ve experienced all in my 28 years of life. I\u2019ve pursued all the things I wanted to and achieved almost all of them, And\nI\u2019ve had good relationships that have lasted years and only ended because we mutually felt it was best. \n\nThings in my life aren\u2019t terrible, but I feel nothing all the time. \nI do things that I think will be fun or enjoyable and I get nothing from it. Foods I tell myself I like taste like ash, songs I enjoy are just mathematical noise I break down mentally for a distraction, maintaining friendships feel about as satisfying as maintaining a houseplant. \nIt\u2019s like my brain doesn\u2019t produce dopamine and it\u2019s getting worse as I get older. \n\nI\u2019ve seen specialists and I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 and anxiety.  I\u2019ve tried about a half dozen medications and it all makes the apathy more apparent. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I felt the need to vent this right now. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 404584, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Chronic apathy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9w7wnz/chronic_apathy/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
