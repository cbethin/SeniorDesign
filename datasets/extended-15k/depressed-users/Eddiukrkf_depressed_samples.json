If you even read all of it thanks. I don\u2019t know what I expect to get out of this but feedback would be nice. \nI\u2019m supposed to be a senior I messed up my life I feel like so much has happened and I\u2019ve done so little to help myself I\u2019m lost in time I don\u2019t know the days some time it haunts me that I\u2019m not in school I got out because I was cutting stressed developing major depression and social anxiety after I got out I got diagnosed with that It all came out of no where but I\u2019m sure it was the school that triggered what had been building  up the high school had a lot of work in a short amount of time doable for awhile and later in the first year we had to be doing college classes I made it so far but started getting panic attacks everyday before I got to school for a week then my mother got me out to get me diagnosed and then she put me on meds which I went into a self destructive state where I abused lorazepam started to forget what I had done some days little after that I got into a lot and blacked out I only remembered some that happened that day it was considered an overdose I took 9 pills should\u2019ve got admitted to a hospital didn\u2019t until a month after didn\u2019t get anything done there but had horrible sleep and didn\u2019t eat really anything for a week another month then I cut myself had to be taken to the hospital and stitched up I\u2019m not really sure if these were attempted suicides I don\u2019t think about this all happened two years ago it feels so much longer but still fresh I wish it was so I could do things different year 10 came tried to got back hid in the administration room for a month only with going to class a few times I was still taking lorazepam but wasn\u2019t abusing but wasn\u2019t helping either I was a bit schizophrenic on it I was done I had a disgusting panic attack I just kept repeating \u2018I don\u2019t want to be here\u2019 \u2018I wanna die\u2019 it was pathetic and embarrassed the administration saw and this other teacher I didn\u2019t know I\u2019ve gotten way better and it\u2019s very pathetic that I\u2019ve been doing nothing for two year I was doing computer work for the first year but that doesn\u2019t count for shit I know I have get my ged and I know there is a package where I can also get my high school diploma I haven\u2019t asked my mom about it I really think she got tried of me I wasn\u2019t the best daughter then and I\u2019m still not now  I\u2019m pretty worthless my dad is isn\u2019t help he was drinking during that time my mom said maybe I haven\u2019t been my best this month too I\u2019ve been cutting again and bruising myself drinking a bit too much i wish I had weed it helps a lot with euphoria and motivation and gives me self esteem and not a care in the world but I don\u2019t want to depend on it because it does too much work this post makes me hurt I wish a was sad and often I sad but I\u2019m not. I do things I like but can\u2019t stick to it but I always go back to it. I\u2019m barely getting taught to drive but my anxiety is fucking it up. But yeah most of the time I\u2019m just watching live music on my phone and only time it get out is if I\u2019m going to the store with my mom and going to concerts with my sister or going to see family which all of this doesn\u2019t even happen often. I\u2019m just taking up space I\u2019d rather be doing productive things with/for the environment (not sure what I mean by this but working around nature I guess)or doing labor work like woodworking. I just want to be a productive person and be social. I\u2019ve had friends like a few weeks ago come up to my house and started to talk to me I gave her my number but nothing I didn\u2019t get hers I want way to nervous. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here.
