I was sad most of the time maybe because I was sensitive and overthinker. Anyways, I lived in pain and over the time it got more intense. I used a lot of meds since then. Prozac, Selectra, Abizol, Efexor, Norodol, Lamictal, Redepra, Anafranil, Paxil are those that I remember. Also I got ECT last March. Now I am taking Lustral, Concerta and something to help me sleep which I can't remember the name but I will edit it.\nThe problem is I am losing ability to think, understand what I read or listen, even talking. I can't express myself properly that's why this thread looks like a mess. I can't put the words in a sentence to express myself. After I read what I wrote, I can't remember if these words even exist. \nWhen I am in a class, (for example a chemistry lab) I can't understand what are the instructions that assistant explained us. I read the book and still nothing comes to my mind. As I'm trying to do what I didn't even understand, I struggle too much. I read same thing over and over again because I forget it when I finish reading.\nI am losing my sense of time and direction too.\nI am at college which is in different city from my home. This is my second year. I suck at social things so there isn't anyone I am close to. I don't even know what to talk anyway. Making this post took half an hour and still it is incomplete.\nI didn't even mention the pain and sadness that I feel. At morning it hurts so much that I can't get out of bed, missed a lot of class. I don't eat enough so I lost some weight. I'm going to class with teary eyes but I can't really cry.\nThen there is anxiety, I am not comfortable around people. I have a hard time to go out and smoke in front of the dorm. People know each other, talks etc. It seems too weird to me that I am like that.\nAlso I have no interests, can't feel happy. I forgot how to feel human feelings so I don't feel a bond between me and people I know.\nThere are a lot of things I forgot to write in this post but I think that's enough for now. Any help is appreciated. Does anyone know what's happening to me?\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 407323, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I think I'm losing my mind", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9yii1k/i_think_im_losing_my_mind/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "TheDarkestPast", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1534672848, "domain": "self.AndroidGaming", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/98j8oo/badland_brawl_soft_launched_in_turkey_and/", "id": "98j8oo", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AndroidGaming/comments/98j8oo/badland_brawl_soft_launched_in_turkey_and/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1534672849, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AndroidGaming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s2ul", "subreddit_subscribers": 131034, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Badland Brawl soft launched in Turkey and probably some other countries", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/98j8oo/badland_brawl_soft_launched_in_turkey_and/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
