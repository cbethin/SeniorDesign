The App Store's layout confuses me these days. (Even though I'm only 25, it's moments like these that I feel like I'm losing my grip on technology...)\n\nMy preferences are simple platformers or story-driven adventures with simple game mechanics. I have anxiety, so it's nice to sit down with a chill game for a bit. (Animals, legend/mythology, and nature are favourite elements!)\n\nI am not good at video games for the most part; I'm often attracted to games for young kids because of their designs, but it's so hard to enjoy them with bouncy music, tacky colours and graphics, lessons about shapes and numbers, and squeaky voiceovers.\n\nI've fallen in love with:\n\n* Fern Flower by Macaque\n* Shine by Fox and Sheep (Designed for children but honestly so satisfying)\n* Thomas Was Alone by Bossa Studios\n* Glowfish by MumboJumbo *(Unavailable for anything after iOS 11, unfortunately.)*\n\nAny suggestions for low-stress, low-skill games like these are so welcome! (I'm also happy to support indie developers, so they don't have to be free!)

I\u2019ve been hiding it because I don\u2019t want to hurt the people that love me. They know I\u2019m struggling a bit, but they don\u2019t know how bad it is right now.

I know for a fact that my friends and family don't deserve my bullshit. I had ambitions but I now think they're fantasies. I will never achieve those goals because I can barely keep myself afloat. I've never done anything worth being proud of by any measure, and I never will.\n\nI've thought about hurting myself. I **know** it's not the answer. My uncle killed himself, I know what it does to a family. I find myself hoping that there will be an accident so I don't have to hurt my family by committing suicide. I have no intentions of acting on these feelings, but I feel so strongly that that's what I deserve.\n\nI DON'T WANT TO BE MENTALLY ILL ANYMORE. I HATE WHO I AM BECAUSE OF IT.

Women and girls are most often the victims, but men and boys also need to feel safe. Rape Culture leads to the freedom of rapists and abusers. Men are most often the perpetrators. It gives them the feeling that they can assault a woman and there won't be consequences. (Touching, groping, cornering, kissing etc.)\n\nAt the same time, there are many people (both men and women) who will never assault anyone, but also don't recognize sexual assault or abuse for what it is. (\"He was just flirting\" \"She was just being playful\" \"He only touched her butt, he didn't hurt her\") Unfortunately, this means that a victim doesn't have much social support, therefore reducing their chances of reporting the incident(s). This also increases the chances of rapists/abusers continuing to assault victims.\n\nDue to the nature of sexual assault, it's difficult to amass concrete evidence for prosecution. Unless the victim reports the incident right away, has the rapist/abuser's DNA or witnesses, it's hard to prove that the incident was assault. Because of this, friends and family of the rapist/abuser don't believe the incident took place and will defend him/her. (\"He's such a nice man, he would never do something like that.\") Unlike a murder scene, where there are usually extremely clear clues that the crime took place and who was involved.\n\nThere's also the issue of consent. Normal people don't document consent for sex. If the victim didn't give consent or rescinds consent or is coerced, it is almost impossible to prove without witnesses or documentation (like video/audio). Then it becomes a matter of he said/she said. When it comes down to that, it is easy to attack the character of the victim and try to discredit them.\n\nShort of the perfect crime with great evidence, it is easy to cast doubt on allegations. Therefore, it can be difficult to prosecute. Therefore, rapists/abusers usually don't have to face serious consequences.\n\nThe reason that this is a relevant cultural problem, though, is **there are a lot of rapists/abusers**. A lot more than you might think. I don't know any women who haven't been harassed/assaulted/raped. (I don't know any male victims, but they are just as important.) It's commonly accepted that if women choose to be outside after dark, wear revealing clothing, drink/do drugs, or find themselves alone with strangers, they are at risk of being harmed. That is severely restricting when it comes to personal freedom and sense of security. That's half the world limited to certain behaviours at certain times of day. (From what I understand, men and boys are commonly assaulted by other men. I don't know enough about these circumstances to write about it, I apologize. But boys and men shouldn't feel unsafe either.)\n\nIt's scary to think that there are thousands of rapists/abusers in our area. That means our personal proximity to a rapist/abuser is uncomfortably close. But without proof, we don't necessarily know who it is. They could be people we trust. When someone we trust is accused of an unexpected and horrendous crime, we are quick to defend their reputation. This is the support network that rapists/abusers rely on to commit their crimes. Victims of rape/abuse are often alienated by their social circles if they speak up about the crime.\n\nAll of this boils down to two behaviours:\n\n1) Victims are faced with a mountain of resistance. They risk their reputations, careers, relationships, mental health, and personal safety if they pursue legal action. Or even social action, like Dr. Blasey Ford, who did not seek charges but wanted to reveal her experience with Kavanaugh to warn others. She has received death threats and will likely need support for her well-being after the experience over the last couple of months. It seems far easier to keep rape/abuse experiences private. This means that rape/abuse statistics can't be accurate, and the chances of prosecuting rapists/abusers is slimmer when the victim doesn't report these incidents.\n\n2) Rapists/abusers will continue to hurt victims physically and emotionally. They can hide their crimes from relevant people (like friends, family, employers, authorities). If they give no reason for anyone to suspect their sexual/violent behaviour, then they can have a life free of a criminal record. Additionally, potential rapists/abusers don't face a significant deterrent from raping/abusing people. These behaviours can start very early in childhood, and without discipline or the fear of law enforcement, they can escalate as that child gets older. That child may even grow up to misunderstand the law, as many people do. Touching someone without their consent is assault. Engaging in sexual activity with an intoxicated person is assault/rape (depending on the circumstances). Respecting someone's right to refuse sexual activity at any time is crucial. Yet it seems that many, many people still violate these boundaries because they can get away with it.\n\nWho in our lives has raped/abused/assaulted someone because they could? No one can tell at a glance. That's why Rape Culture instils wariness, fear, caution, and anger in potential victims. It restricts certain behaviours and opportunities. It would be an extremely different and more free society if rape/abuse/assault wasn't a significant risk, and we as individuals could feel confident that we would be treated with dignity and respect by others.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "u_Vaches", "subreddit_id": "t5_3pxtr", "subreddit_subscribers": 0, "subreddit_type": "user", "suggested_sort": "qa", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "re: Rape Culture's Significance", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Vaches/comments/9mvt1a/re_rape_cultures_significance/"}, {"author": "Vaches", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_r5vxn", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539116942, "domain": "self.JUSTNOMIL", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9msqws/mil_is_a_smallminded_ignorant_coward_and_im_done/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9msqws", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a04a6bfc-84ff-11e5-a8cd-0eb245cbd535", "link_flair_text": "(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9msqws/mil_is_a_smallminded_ignorant_coward_and_im_done/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539116943, "score": 1, "selftext": "I started dating my boyfriend when we were 15. We were on and off for a few years - we were just teenagers after all - but got back together when we were 19. It's been 6 years of going steady. (We don't live together yet, though. Trying to save money for a house and all.) My family loves him and they get along pretty well. He's welcome in our home anytime. His family welcomed me from day one - with the exception of his mother.\n\nI am white, and they are not, so that's strike one. I never did well in school - strike two. I'm vegetarian - strike three. The list goes on. She has never bothered to get to know me and judges me based on my job, my diet, my appearance...just superficial things that don't mean a lot to me and are in no way a measure of my character. I still tried to be nice and respectful because, well, she's SO's mom and for his sake I wanted to get along. I ignored years of backhanded comments and gossip that got back to me. Starting drama with her is **dramatic** \\- it was easier for me to keep quiet. I didn't want to upset SO or make her turn his family against me, so I sucked it up.\n\nOur difficult relationship came to a head two years ago. One day I got a text out of the blue from SO saying, \"Mom just asked if you have Down Syndrome.\"\n\nLike...what?\n\nI started to cry almost immediately. How could a grown-ass adult woman say that? Why would she suddenly invent that I have a syndrome? Does she really dislike me **so much** that I seem disabled to her?! It really hurt to know that she said that about me behind my back. It is so ridiculous and far-fetched and cruel.\n\nI texted back SO to get more information, and to find out how he was defending me. (Spoiler: he wasn't.) Apparently she had been discussing me with her SILs the weekend prior, pondering if I had Down Syndrome because I have a big forehead and blue eyes and yellow teeth. (Fuck you, too!)\n\nI was 23 years old and didn't really have a backbone. I was just so sad that someone could hate me. When I stopped crying, I told my mom what happened. I was feeling resigned to the fact that MIL was just mean and immature. I told my mom just as a way to vent and get over it. I didn't think it was that bad. But my mom got really angry. She was super calm, but very, very angry. She normally doesn't get involved, but she turned into mama bear.\n\nAfter talking about the situation for a couple of hours, she hopped on Facebook and typed up a message to my SO. I don't remember what it said exactly, but it was along the lines of, \"You tell your mother that the next time she wants to question the number of chromosomes my family has, she can come talk to me herself instead of hiding behind her son.\" (Much longer and more strongly-worded, of course.)\n\nI got a text a few minutes later from him, complaining that his mom was now yelling at him. He showed her the message; I guess she felt cornered because someone was blaming her for her cowardice. She thought she could bully me without consequences, but someone called her out - something she wasn't used to. (He got no sympathy from me - he put himself in the middle! He got himself into that situation! He could have just shut her down to begin with!)\n\nI didn't confront her. I decided to put this incident on the back burner and wait for the right time to handle it. My mom, however, will certainly have it out with MIL the first opportunity she gets. (Our parents haven't even met to this day.)\n\nIt was during that day that I lost all respect for her. I don't try to impress her anymore. I can try to be the best DIL, but my flaws will always overshadow my goodness. I know that once SO and I move in together, get married, have kids - it will get worse. I'll take it one day at a time with her.\n\nAnd yes - SO made some crucial mistakes here. We talked through it. It isn't his fault his mother said those things, and even if it wasn't right, I'm glad he told me. It was the straw that broke the camel's back on many levels.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "JUSTNOMIL", "subreddit_id": "t5_377ps", "subreddit_subscribers": 440027, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "MIL is a small-minded, ignorant coward and I'm done being nice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9msqws/mil_is_a_smallminded_ignorant_coward_and_im_done/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Vaches", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1526585628, "domain": "self.jackboxgames", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jackboxgames/comments/8k71n9/streaming_jackbox_party_pack/", "id": "8k71n9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jackboxgames/comments/8k71n9/streaming_jackbox_party_pack/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1526585629, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I love Jackbox games, but I don't have any friends nearby to play with!\nI just got the Party Pack, and I'm thinking about streaming tonight around 11pm EDT.

Ultimately, we want to be together for many more years, but I don't feel very secure with him.\n\nHere is some background before I get into the details relating to my question:\n\nMy boyfriend views himself as a successful, logical, efficient person. In general, he is extremely talented and rarely fails at his tasks - whether they're related to school, work, or his personal life. He is proud, meticulous, plans ahead, and works hard. He has completed several years of post-secondary school and may even get a doctorate... I hope that paints a decent picture of how his life seems to be organized just so.\n\nThere are many things about me that are quite the opposite of him, however. I've always hated academia and barely graduated high school. I am not hard-working or dedicated, I'm messy, I'm almost always running late, and I'm wildly emotional. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and very recently ADHD. My illnesses make everything in my life extremely difficult from getting out of bed to keeping my living space tidy. The anxiety makes me question and loathe myself constantly. I think I have a poor memory as well.\n\nI've been wondering about gaslighting for a few months now. I've been reading up on it, but I don't know if my sense of reality is being manipulated. The fact that I can't say for sure is probably a massive red flag. But I also don't want to jump to conclusions! If I accuse him of gaslighting (so we can identify the issue and repair the relationship) I know it will hurt his feelings and it's likely he will deflect. I'm asking for your input so I have a better idea of what I'm going through.\n\nWhen we were nineteen years old and trying out our new relationship, he would blatantly compare me to other women in his life and point out how I could improve. (At one point he said something like me and another girl were two halves of a whole, fulfilling relationship.) He called me stupid and childish often. He has since apologized for (some) of this behaviour and has not done anything like it since, but I think these actions have hurt me very deeply and instilled a permanent sense of uncertainty.\n\nI constantly battle with mental illness. Constantly. Some days are better than others. On bad days, he has never made me feel better. I've chalked this up to perhaps a low emotional intelligence. But I also feel like he has never tried to make me feel better... He doesn't compliment me or reassure me, even when I ask for it. If I get upset and tell him \"You've never called me pretty\" his reply would be \"But you know I think that.\" When I feel vulnerable and I ask for him to express any sentiment, he always responds with \"But you know that\" or some variation without ever saying anything sentimental. He does not hold back with criticism, however.\n\nFor the last couple of months we've been going through a rough patch. And almost every day he has made a remark about me not doing something right. Last Friday morning he made such a remark (\"Once again not doing what you said you would\") and it was the straw that broke the camel's back: it triggered an anxiety attack and I started crying. I immediately called him, in tears, and...well, it was an unsatisfying conversation. I asked him why he would say that, why he wanted to make me feel bad, what kind of reaction he wanted and he said, \"Sometimes people in relationships express themselves. I was just expressing that I was exasperated. It wasn't my intention to make you feel bad.\" When I said he hurt my feelings and I no longer wanted to go on a date that afternoon, he insisted that because I made a commitment to meet him I should follow through and show up.\n\nI did go out with him, and sure it was fun, but when I got home I felt hollow.\n\nOn occasions when we're together in person and we have an argument, he gets angry and falls silent and waits for me to explain myself. His sentences are terse and condescending. I'm at fault a lot of the time, but I can't stand the cold shoulder, and I've told him often that when he doesn't speak, it's terrifying. I can't stick up for myself when he does that, so there could be an hour or more where no one says anything; him because he's fuming and waiting for me to justify myself, and me because alarm bells are going off in my head that he hates me. Yet he still does this.\n\nThis is usually the case when I have moments of distress. He doesn't comfort me. I don't know if that's because he doesn't know how or...? I've sent him lots of links and articles over the years on how to be a partner to someone who has depression/anxiety, examples of how to compliment your partner, and even told him things that I want to hear once in a while. He's insisted that he's changed his behaviour?? But I don't see it. And I'm not sure if that's because I'm ignoring it and taking it for granted or if it's because he's exaggerating his contributions.\n\nI just don't know if I'm skewing this because I'm mentally ill and my moods and actions are inconsistent, therefore tarnishing my attitudes towards him or if he's really, really not trying hard enough. If he is gaslighting me, I don't think it's not a conscious choice.\n\nWe went to a counsellor earlier this year for another matter and after a few weeks I walked away feeling like he turned the counsellor against me. I don't know if these feelings are just in my head. It's messing with my confidence and self-esteem horribly. I plan on getting a therapist for myself, so if you agree that it's just me, then I'm on my way to getting some help.\n\n ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I can't tell if my boyfriend is using my illnesses and emotions against me to take away my self-confidence, therefore relying on him for stability.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is my boyfriend (24M) of 5 years gaslighting me (24F)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7crtxm/is_my_boyfriend_24m_of_5_years_gaslighting_me_24f/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Vaches", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492099113, "domain": "self.nosleep", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/656cu3/2_treatment_gone_scary_this_is_getting_really/", "id": "656cu3", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/656cu3/2_treatment_gone_scary_this_is_getting_really/", "retrieved_on": 1494592212, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "nosleep", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "2.

After having some trouble at work, I decided to finally talk to my doctor. I listed my symptoms and she gave me official diagnoses: clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I wish I'd known that before I was twenty-three - treatment when I was a kid would have avoided a whole host of issues while growing up! Oh well, the best I can do now is move forward with treatment. So the doc gave me a prescription for escitalopram, which seems pretty common. Two popular brands are Lexapro and Cipralex. So, I've started medication.\n\nNow, I've waited a month to talk about this because I've heard that adverse side effects can go away after four to six weeks. Only, the side effects aren't going away... I feel pretty nauseated and I've thrown up a few times. I also yawn constantly, which does not feel like is related to fatigue at all. I just get the urge to yawn like every half hour. It looks pretty unprofessional. Those effects aren't terrible, but... It's so strange. I'm experiencing new things that I haven't read about anywhere. When it comes to sleep problems, it seems like most people experience fatigue during the day, not sleeplessness, and not what I'm going through... This is why I'm on /nosleep. This forum is so popular, I thought someone might have a clue as to how to help me get some rest.\n\nFor about a week, at around nine o'clock I've been getting a wicked headache, which makes it almost impossible to relax. It's almost like a migraine. I take a Tylenol when it hits. Around ten-thirty the pain subsides enough that I can drift off. But after that... I'm woken with a jolt, or I think I'm awake. You know how you feel like you're falling? It's like that. And then I'm gripped with fear. I mean, I'm already scared of the dark, so maybe that's all it is... There's a corner of my bedroom that - when the lights are off - looks completely black. When I wake up like this, I get the overwhelming sinking feeling that there's a figure in that corner, watching me... Does anyone else feel like this? I swear I saw the outline of a head and shoulders once. I've been too afraid to move. I feel like all I can do is close my eyes and tell myself it's not real, until exhaustion knocks me out.\n\nIf anyone is interested in helping, that would be amazing. This sleep thing has only been going on for a week and already it's making me paranoid. The only thing stopping me from sleeping on the couch tonight is the bay window in the living room; if there's one thing that I'm more afraid of than the dark, it's windows at night.\n\nTo give you some background information on who I am:\n\nI'm a twenty-three-year-old woman, 5'6 and 140lbs. I work full-time as a receptionist at a vet clinic - sort of long hours but not stressful. (In fact I'm writing this at work during a slow period.) I live alone in a bungalow I inherited from my grandmother, sort of. Well I'm not totally alone, I have a few small pets (two birds, a turtle, a rabbit). I live in a decent neighbourhood; domestic disturbances and drunk/high individuals getting into fights are the only trouble here. Break-ins are uncommon, and besides, I'm such a scaredy-cat that I keep my doors and most of my windows locked at all times. No one is in my house.\n\nSo anyway, if anyone knows anything about escitalopram, please leave a comment or send me a message about what's going on with me.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOkay so I initially scribbled this out at work and I was going to transcribe it to the computer. After visiting /nosleep again, I saw lots of posts about weird stuff, and I held back on writing this - I thought this sub was for sleeping problems, but it's definitely not! But something fucking creepy happened to me today.\n\nLast night I drank some wine before bed to try to relax myself. I know, alcohol is a depressant and it could worsen my depression symptoms, but can you blame me? I just wanted to feel less tense, and I didn't even drink that much - just to get a slight buzz. I thought the alcohol would slip me into deep sleep easier and prevent me from waking up.\n\nIt didn't work. My problem evolved.\n\nI think I experienced sleep paralysis. I have night terrors now and again, but this was new. And worse.\n\nI woke up to the sound of someone dragging on a cigarette. It was right in my left ear. I could hear the sound of them exhale slowly. I couldn't see or smell any smoke in the air, though, so some part of me knew it wasn't real, but I was paralyzed with terror. It seemed to be like that forever. Breathing. Slowly, in and out. Drags on the cigarette. Breathe out the nonexistent smoke. It sounded male - deep chested. This made it all the more awful.\n\nAt some point I passed out. But I woke up again.\n\nI could feel the figure in the corner again. There was just the normal shadow, but I could feel the presence. And then the shadow was growing, slowly, just expanding. Creeping over the walls and the ceiling inch by inch. It was like tunnel vision. And while this was happening, there was the sound.\n\nYou know how, in audio, people can distort their voice to be really low? Like that EDM song Tsunami? It was like that - a low voice, so loud, but it wasn't echoing so I knew it was just inside my head. But it was so loud, YELLING at me. But it was gibberish. Garbled consonants SHOUTING.\n\nHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKXHTHGPRGNNQDGSHBMWZPTYNMRGTHBSCWKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAs suddenly as it started, it all stopped. The spell was broken, and I could move again. The shadow was back to normal. I was soaked in sweat; I rolled out of bed and went to get a glass of water.\n\nSleep paralysis isn't uncommon. I wouldn't be so concerned about a hallucination if it wasn't for the note I found on the front step.\n\n\"MAINTENANT TU PEUX VOIR.\"\n\nIt looked like it was written by a five-year-old. It's French for \"Now you can see.\" Where I live, French is uncommon; I'm one of few who can speak it fluently in the area. You'd have to go east towards Ottawa if you wanted to find francophones. The creepiest part was that the note was written on the back of a form from the clinic that I had faxed earlier this week; it had my name and signature.\n\nIs this a threat? Am I being paranoid?! Maybe this doesn't have anything to do with the hallucinations?? This could be a coincidence??? Oh what the fuck should I do.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/656cu3/2_treatment_gone_scary_this_is_getting_really/)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "nosleep", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Treatment Gone Scary", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64zz5v/treatment_gone_scary/", "view_count": null}, {"author": "Vaches", "author_flair_css_class": "roastlink", "author_flair_text": "http://redd.it/4ve3cr", "created_utc": 1469914281, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/4ve3cr/im_ready_for_permanent_damage_to_my_selfimage/", "id": "4ve3cr", "is_self": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 57, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/RoastMe/comments/4ve3cr/im_ready_for_permanent_damage_to_my_selfimage/", "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "Y7AM93V-hjy3APUB6NB-41bgw3llZeo2O58Y4OC9ewg", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/nbdxztGrIMCNXcPQcO4SU4-_mELw6MdqyKOuXaVLuQI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=2a4ff015ad608b845712b3ca39ff48a5", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/nbdxztGrIMCNXcPQcO4SU4-_mELw6MdqyKOuXaVLuQI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=fc01ec8b0a9317a56450996f45c32ec4", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/nbdxztGrIMCNXcPQcO4SU4-_mELw6MdqyKOuXaVLuQI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=693f5f955b4d0824c903c2ad9db3a999", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/nbdxztGrIMCNXcPQcO4SU4-_mELw6MdqyKOuXaVLuQI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=1fef73ef946d2047fa218713cbabae29", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/nbdxztGrIMCNXcPQcO4SU4-_mELw6MdqyKOuXaVLuQI.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=7093c7e74ca6c2a87d26da73d1953e3c", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/nbdxztGrIMCNXcPQcO4SU4-_mELw6MdqyKOuXaVLuQI.jpg?s=9e5928f6d04e9355084d12d5277cc163", "width": 960}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1473002803, "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "RoastMe", "subreddit_id": "t5_37xo2", "thumbnail": "http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Wvp-CX8yR0Ni1Hei7Xzt6axH5EMvvJ2WvCOfM-Y994o.jpg", "title": "I'm ready for permanent damage to my self-image", "url": "https://i.redd.it/i5sxqfsuzfcx.jpg"}, {"author": "Vaches", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1449258851, "domain": "self.nosleep", "edited": 1449259087, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3vgdss/new_medication/", "id": "3vgdss", "is_self": true, "link_flair_text": "Removed | Non-Story", "locked": false, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/3vgdss/new_medication/", "retrieved_on": 1454893952, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "nosleep", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "New Medication", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3vgdss/new_medication/"}, {"author": "Vaches", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1445451787, "domain": "self.nanowrimo", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nanowrimo/comments/3pnyxb/longtime_writer_firsttime_nano/", "id": "3pnyxb", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/nanowrimo/comments/3pnyxb/longtime_writer_firsttime_nano/", "retrieved_on": 1450715894, "score": 17, "selftext": "I vaguely heard about NaNo a few years ago but was never really sure about what it was.

Carry a notebook with me throughout the day so when ideas come they can be jotted down before the allotted writing time.\n5. Keep a thesaurus on standby.\n6. Don't get stuck on romance. Romance is a subplot. SUBPLOT.\n7. Remind myself that this is going to be hard. Putting words on the page, even if it looks like garbage, is progress.
