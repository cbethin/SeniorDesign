"selftext": "Hi everyone, I hope you can take the time and read my really long post. I would really appreciate it. A lot of paragraphs are just my jumbled thoughts, I'm sorry it's not very organized. \nI was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social anxiety about 3 years ago. I am on my third depressive episode. I am also a person who stutters. I am currently in my first semester of grad school studying speech-language pathology in the Midwest about 2000 miles away from home. My fianc\u00e9e of 9 years is back in California. As a person with social anxiety, I'm having an extremely difficult time making friends. My cohort has a group chat going and every time I come up with the courage to text them and ask if anyone wants to go out or do anything, nobody responds. This has happened more than once, so I've already given up. I'm the only guy in my cohort so I feel very isolated. \nI'm living in a grad student dorm on campus and no one is friendly here. Some people don't even say hello. I've been pushing myself to talk to these people but they just seem indifferent.\nI'm taking classes full-time and I have clients that I have to treat as part of the program. They just threw us in to clinic in our first semester. It's been a month already and I still don't feel comfortable treating these clients. I'm having to treat clients who stutter, which I don't mind because we've had similar experiences in terms of speech, but honestly my stuttering is worse than theirs. How can I treat someone if I can't treat myself? I've come to terms with my stuttering over the years, accepted that I'll never be fluent. But recently it has been affecting me. I've always had trouble speaking up in groups and in class. \nI've had speech therapy before, which is the main reason why I am pursuing this career path. But now I am thinking if this was the wrong choice. My motivation is completely gone. I'm lying in bed right now as I type this on my phone. So please excuse any typos lol.\nI've had a therapist and psychiatrist back in California. I actually stopped taking antidepressants earlier this year. I didn't think I was getting any results and my brain just felt foggy all the time. Around that time, I started smoking marijuana, which I fell in love with. I would smoke once in a while, but it would help numb the pain..I would be able to stutter freely and not care what people thought. I could go out and have fun with friends. \nNow I smoke almost every day, which I know is not good for me. But I want this pain to go away. I need an alternative because I'm running out and I can't get medical marijuana in this state.\nI've tried exercising but it only lasts about a day. \nNot being with my fianc\u00e9e has taken a huge toll on me. I used to rely on her for everything. Because of my social anxiety, sometimes I wouldn't even go out to eat until she came home. I need her more than ever now. She's going to visit me in a few weeks which is the only thing I'm looking forward to right now.\nThere's a counselor center here on campus but you have to call them. As a person who stutters and has social anxiety, this is impossible for me. \nI've thought about suicide many times but I can't give up. I've given up on so many things in my life. This is my third career choice. I'm much older than the rest of my cohort which is a bit embarrassing. If I quit, I have no idea what I would do. I've spent so much money on school and I've made it this far already. My family would be really disappointed in me.\nI don't know what to do. Reddit, please help.\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 391128, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Depression.

I used to not be able to get out of bed and go to work because I would PMO.\n\nI deleted all of the porn that I had when I started and I immediately regretted it. But, I am glad that I did. I installed an extension on chrome to block some of the sites as well. \n\nI suffer from major depressive disorder and I felt good the first few days of quitting. But, recently my mood has been down and I just want to watch something to make me happy. I seriously can't stop thinking about it. \n\nI want to thank you all in advance for your support. These posts have been helpful to me and definitely have motivated me to quit PMO.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "pornfree", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rglh", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Porn is EVERYWHERE!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/4abe7n/porn_is_everywhere/"}]}
