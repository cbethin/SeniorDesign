Add eating disorder (I eat my feelings, literally) into it and you have the perfect mix.\n\nSince I moved a 4 - 5 years ago my life took a turn for the worst and my depression started getting bad. I gained weight, couldn't work out because I hate doing it and then my eating disorder. It is safe to say I'm pretty suicidal as well.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with PCOS which made me hate my body because it \"betrayed\" me and I kept treating mts bad. My gyno asked me to stop exercising which I kept trying and quitting. Finally my mom and I purchased a pretty expensive machine for me to exercise which we couldn't really afford but she insisted so that I would exercise.\n\nNow the real problem is that I absolutely hate exercising. I even because a Fitness Instructor so that it could be motivated but absolutely nothing motivates me. Today I pushed myself to workout on it for at least 30 minutes and I instantly broke down the minute I was done. Now I regret buying it because I'm worried I won't use it and I wasted my mom's money.\n\nHow do I motivate myself? I'm very suicidal and frequently have break downs in public but nobody can tell because I cover my face. I used to love reading but I can't be arsed to read anymore because it feels like a real task.\n\nOne more thing I noticed about myself is that I kind of try to gain people's pity. I know how pathetic it sounds and I don't really want anyone's pity but I have been doing it subconsciously for years probably.\n\nI apologise for the length, any and all help is appreciated.\n\nTLDR; I'm depressed af and need help on how to exercise without feeling like shit.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 403495, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do I not feel like shit after exercising?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9vepqk/how_do_i_not_feel_like_shit_after_exercising/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "being_bi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1t7qzlxi", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539428022, "domain": "self.legaladvice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9nsx7c/how_do_i_get_my_remaining_salary/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9nsx7c", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9ab2b520-bbb7-11e5-9b5a-0e403c3c1dc1", "link_flair_text": "Employment Law", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/legaladvice/comments/9nsx7c/how_do_i_get_my_remaining_salary/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539428023, "score": 1, "selftext": "I worked for a small gym in February 2018 for 1 month. I was fired as I couldn't meet my target which was okay with me. We did not decide on my salary before joining hence I was told we would get back to it later which never really happened. I asked the gym owner for my salary which he said he would give me once he has enough money as he had none due to me not being able to sell enough membership (I think it's bullshit as he has enough money to get 2 latest phones and shit). To make it clear, he was aware that I'm a fresher. After leaving the job, what followed was months of me asking for my salary and him berating me saying \"I did nothing\" and that I HAD to wait etc. Nearly 2 month back after months of nagging and me threatening him that I will go to the cops, I got 75% of my salary (which I decided upon considering if it would have been up to him then he would have went as low as he wanted) that he promised me that he would give it to me after a few days as that's all he had. This went on for some weeks and now today I texted him as a final warning since he was ignoring my texts since few days. He texted back saying how much sale did I do for his gym and stuff basically try to prove I did nothing (which is untrue and the situation was shitty and he used to put a lot of pressure which made me feel horrible). I texted him back giving all the reasons why I was unsuccessful which pissed him off which is when he asked me to \"shut up\" and shit. Basically, I think he blocked me from What's App. Honestly, I'm so over this and really frustrated considering how much I have to cry to get what I rightfully deserve.\n\nTL;DR - My ex employer refuses to give me my remaining salary even though it's been 7 months since I worked there. He also probably blocked me from What's App.\n\nAny and all advise is appreciated.\n\nAlso, I'm based in India if it helps.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "legaladvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "subreddit_subscribers": 542509, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do I get my remaining salary?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9nsx7c/how_do_i_get_my_remaining_salary/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "being_bi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1t7qzlxi", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539352588, "domain": "self.Cooking", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/9nkhgb/how_long_will_cooked_instant_noodles_last/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9nkhgb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/9nkhgb/how_long_will_cooked_instant_noodles_last/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539352588, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm at a hotel where I have no means of cooking at night and due my job my sleep cycle is weird which keeps me up all night and makes me hungry quickly hence, this is my best bet.
