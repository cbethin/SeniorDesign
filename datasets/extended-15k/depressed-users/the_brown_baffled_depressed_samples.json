Our friendship has deepen and we became best friends, telling each other our secrets and always hang out and talking a lot with each other.\n\nWe then involved in a relationship after she got ready and felt that she loves me. However, she was depressed and felt lonely and i was always feeling responsible and trying to cheer her up many times i succeeded and sometimes i failed. Note: \"she was depressed before our relationship but she did not accept any help from me or want to talk about it to me\". \n\nHaving the burden of her depression on me, i was feeling sad and she was saying that i helped her but she feels sad after our talk or when she is being alone and my tries make her happy or forget about her misery only momentarily. That makes me sad even more because i felt more responsible.\n\nBeing sad, i felt that our love is becoming hollow, and she felt that i am away of her despite the fact that i am always besides her in the university in the home at almost every instant, but sometime to be fair my soul wasn't there. That made us fight frequently and the last fight, i explained to her what i feel and how i feel responsible for her misery and hopeless because i can't cheer her up or bring the intimacy to our relationship. She frightened and became more sad. In that instant i felt deep sorrow but i couldn't let those thoughts in my head.\n\nA weak after that incident i did not go to the university, but she was very depressed that day and feeling insecure, i knew that and went to her but she pushed me away and told me to go away. i stayed away for some time but returned to her and told her to solve our assignment together, we did that and she got more opened. but then when we left she pushed me again and i felt insecure, sad and that she did not appreciate me or  what i was doing.\n\nSome days later, while maintaining the same behavior, she came to me and told me that she wants to break up without giving any reason, after some talking she told me that she feels that she is too immature to be in a relationship. Then she told me that she wants us to be friends like before without any love feelings. i responded furiously and refused, fought with her and it was ugly. \n\nAt the end i calmed down, i am still feeling that i love her, i am stalking her tumblr account, and i know that she is in deep misery and needs a friend, i want to be that friend, but then i remember that she pushed me back. I feel responsible and empathy toward her. I don't know what should i do and don't know how should i return. \n\nSorry for the long words but believe me, i only noticed how many words after i finished writing because i am writing all of my head so i won't be crazy due to overthinking                                \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: \nmy girlfriend was feeling sad for long times and i felt responsible that i could not cheer her up, so i told how and what i feel. She felt even sadder, After a week she got depressed and pushed me away for some days while she was desperately needing someone and no one was there, then she decided to break up with me but she told me that she wants us to be friends, i responded angrily but now i feel more love and empathy that she is alone.
