The reason I feel so much fucking pain. \n\nI never wanted it to reach this point. Hell I didn\u2019t even know I could reach this point. But I did. I was diagnosed with depression at just age 10. I\u2019m now 22. Over the course of 5 years, beginning when I was 17, I\u2019ve gone through one heartbreak after another. I could never find that perfect girl to bring home to mom. Introduce her to the family. Because of my depression, it freaked some girls out. The way I thought, the way I acted, just about every aspect of myself that depression had taken over. Most people tell me that you should stop focusing on looking for a relationship. It\u2019ll come to you and all that. I\u2019ve heard it a million times. And while there is truth in that, I lacked a lot of love and support from my parents. I have three sisters and I\u2019m the only boy in my family, but my parents focused more on them and their needs than me. So because of all that absent love and attention, I\u2019ve been trying to fill that in with relationships. Unfortunately I\u2019ve had worst luck with that. I ran into women who seemed genuine at first but showed their true colors as time went by. I was cheated on several times and whenever I would confront them, they tried to turn the tables on me, blame me for cheating. I was once even sent a snapchat of a girl I was starting to love having sex with her ex. She didnt sent it but he did and that fucked me up good. It really did. Imagine watching the person you love having sex with someone else and not give two shits about how you\u2019re feeling. Because of that, my heart felt destroyed and I tried to commit suicide because it felt like the only way to escape that pain. I tried to overdose but was rushed to the hospital in time and had my stomach pumped. After I was released, I isolated myself for a very long time. I still was trying to seek a relationship but became even more cautious than before. Treading carefully. A few months later, I met another girl who seemed perfect. We connected so fast. We had the same interests. Being strangers, I was there for her a lot and helped her with personal matters. Things were shaping up and looking great. I really felt like I had found the one. But just as quickly as we began dating, things were already starting to fall apart. I later found out she was incrediblely insecure and was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Those two together was a nightmare. She accused me of cheating. She threatened to leave me. She said things that she knew would cause me to overthink and become upset. She talked about wanting to have sex with other guys just for the hell of it. My depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts came back so fast. I was genuinely happy in my relationship at first so it felt like I could finally breathe. Now I was back where I didnt want to be at. I started self harming and I attempted again, this time by hanging. I guess I can tie a noose for shit because only seconds after, the rope came loose. After so much emotional trauma and abuse I left her. It was hard because deep down I truly loved her. But I wasnt suppose to feel like this. I feel stupid and pathetic for letting love be the reason I feel pain. I\u2019m looking again and I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. I know I need a break. I need my alone time. But dammit I just want to be loved for once! I want someone to accept me how I am for once! Not criticize me! Not make me feel like shit for how I am! I try to not be someone that I\u2019m not. I give people the real me and that isnt good enough.

though he was mostly talking about its holiday sales. When this prediction turned out to be untrue, Pachter apologized and called a sequel \"a possibility.\"\n\n2009: Composer Shawn Lee says \u2018It looks like I will be doing the soundtrack for Bully 2 in the not so distant future\u2019.\n\n2011: Dan Houser says studio may focus on a Bully sequel after the release of Max Payne 3 stating\n\n\u201cContrary to a lot of people, we like to take a little bit of time at the end of a game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game. So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with Rockstar Vancouver\u2013 even though it is a property that, like Max Payne, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max Payne, and then we will see what we can do with Bully.\u201d\n\n2013: Dan Houser says that he has many different ideas for a Bully sequel\n\n2013: Take-Two files new Bully trademark in Europe\n\n2013: A resume-blog by Stan Capton, an uncredited voice artist in Bully, was discovered. In the blog, Capton claimed to be working on an action-adventure game for Take Two Interactive. The blog cited the game in question as 'TBD\u2019\n\n2015: A hoax that Bully 2 was set to be released in October 2016 was started. The fake news story appeared on a few different sites but the hoax's origin is unknown.\n\n2016: Rockstar Games release Bully as a digital download for the PS4, backwards compatible on Xbox One, and the Anniversary Edition for mobile devices in conjuction with the games 10 year anniversay. While it doesn\u2019t say much, it does indicate Rockstar has not forgotten about the franchise. This may also be a strategy to regenerate interest in the game.\n\n2017: Concept art of a sequel game in development leaks online.\n\n2018: Request for a \u201cnew unannounced video game title with a leading UK games developer, shooting at Pinewood Studios,\u201d have been making the rounds. The casting calls are reportedly looking for people to fill young roles, none of which have been given full character names. Details of the roles include: \u201cMild violence and profanity will be used in scenes with the young performer. \u201cThe project itself is a thriller/drama, and all scenes with the young performer will be handled with sensitivity.\u201d There have also been calls for actors to fill college professor roles, and just might be a sequel to Bully.\n\n2018: Red Dead Redemption 2 contains two references (that we know of so far) to Bully. The first is a revolver with \u2018Canis Canem Edit\u2019 engraved on it, the name for Bully in Europe. The second is when you complete the game and epilogue. You will unlock a trophy titled \u2018Endless Summer\u2019 which is the final chapter in Bully.  \n\nIt could just be an easter egg but, is it possible it's a little tease that Rockstar Games next release is a Bully sequel? It's unlikely, but it's possible. Only big Bully fans like myself are keeping their fingers crossed. Given how so many different things keep leaking and how much Bully is brought up several times by Houser himself, I have faith.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

I\u2019m 20 years old. I live in Chicago. Big music junkie, gamer, and I\u2019m also a photographer. I\u2019ve had depression since I was 10. I\u2019ve attempted suicide three times over the course of 5 years. Most importantly, I don\u2019t have friends and I\u2019m genuinely looking to meet new people here who I can talk\nabout these things as well as people who share the same interests that I do.\n\nMost of my friends are female, but they aren\u2019t as active in my life anymore. and I only have one male best friend. He also suffers from severe depression so its hard to talk to him about things when he views everything negatively. When I help him it\u2019s genuinely positive advice. With him, not so much. I don\u2019t really speak to him that much. I relatively keep a distance from him, especially when I try to get myself together and the energy he passes onto me is not good. \n\nAs for my female friends, I had three, they were great people but at the same time there was some kind of sexual tension with each and then some and all that messed with my thought process. One of them, very beautiful by the way, I actually had a crush on and she was flirting back but then awhile later pretended like it never happened, and I held a grudge against her for that. Another slept over my house on Mothers Day because her mom had passed away, and I didn\u2019t want her to be alone on a day like that. She had a boyfriend at the time, but that night she was hinting that she wanted to have sex, as she was grinding against me and sitting on top of me to where I was inches away from her face. I\u2019ve been the cheated on person before and I didn\u2019t want to be in that situation so I never made a move. She had gotten into a fight with her boyfriend because he never spoke to her about her mom. She clearly was gonna use me as a rebound and when I didn\u2019t have sex with her, she stopped talking to me. The last one, my closest one of them all, made me hold her and starting grinding against me as well during a concert. We went to another a week later, and again, same thing. I never made a move because its like, do these girls really care about me, or do they just want something from me? I don\u2019t know and most people will say \u2018you\u2019re stupid for not having sex with them\u2019 but its not really the sex I wanted from them, just someone to talk to and share interests and hobbies with. If I constantly relied on them for sex, I would never be able to advance and find a relationship because I\u2019d be emotionally invested in them, since each one I did have a fling with at some point. Sex is cool, yeah, and believe me when I say these women are beautiful, but its not what I wanted.\n\nNeither of them were there when I attempted to take my life, the last attempt being in October and spent 10 days locked up in a psych ward. No one visited. No one checked up on me after I checked out. Again, they just wanted me for their own desires and purposes.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you guys how many times I\u2019ve reached out to the Suicide Prevention Hotline and most of the time, if not all the time actually, I get no response. And when I do it\u2019s really nothing helpful, or something that would prevent me from doing anything harm to myself. Honestly they sound like the last place they want to be is there. I don\u2019t know what your guys\u2019 experience has been with the hotline but mine have been bad overall. \n\nJust really want to meet some cool Reddit friends. Talk about music. Talk about gaming. Talk about life. Even play sometime together (I have Xbox One, but I do plan on purchasing a PS4 soon). If you live in Chicago, fantastic, we could be great friends!
