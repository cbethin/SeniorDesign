Almost a year ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar. I've lived with my great grandparents for most of my life. I was taken to the ER by my mom and her boyfriend around December of 2017, and they sent me to inpatient. Everything was great (for what it was), and they put my on Zyprexa AKA Olanzapine. After a few months, around March of 2018, they told me I was \"fine\" and discharged me. Okay, so things were getting better. I decided to switch to online schooling because I was so far behind in school, which was the worst decision of my life. After awhile I stopped doing my work, and the only reason I'm in high school is because they couldn't hold back a person in middle school for their first year at this school. Skip forward to July 2018, I had to stop seeing my therapist because my insurance wouldn't cover it. I can't go to the ER because my insurance won't cover it. I stopped taking my meds because of all of the side effects. I've been missing school lately, and every time I decide to not go to school, my grandma yells at me. Telling me how worthless I am, how I'm nowhere in life, how she's going to kick me out of the house, etc. Yesterday, I decided to not go to school due to staying up for 24 hours and hallucinating. Same exact thing happened, she told me how I affect her life in so many negative ways, how she has to go to some place important and how I'm wasting her time. After about 30 minutes of this repetitive bullshit, she asks me why I'm not going to school. I say, \"You don't understand the things that I have to go through.\" So she says, \"Like what?\" As if nothing happened in this past year. At that point I got up off my bed and was ready to beat the shit out of her. And I probably would of if she didn't leave my room. I don't know what to do, the only thing keeping me alive is music. Can anybody give me some advice?", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 407807, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9yxn8e/hello/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
