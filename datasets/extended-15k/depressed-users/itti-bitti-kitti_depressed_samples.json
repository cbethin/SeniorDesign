I had already had a bad day. You all know those days when you feel on edge and upset right from the start. Yesterday was the first time I'd self-harmed in... ages. Years. I already spoke to my therapist, I knew why I did it, I knew it was because of a recent huge life change that sparked all of that. I just wanted to go out, breathe fresh air, and buy some stuff at the store. I wanted to grab some decorations first since we're having Thanksgiving at my house, and I love decorating, so I thought it would be perfect for me for a little perk up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shopped around for a few minutes, turned the corner, and there he was. The first time I'd seen him since pressing charges (awaiting court still), and I could feel the color drain from my face. Time stood still. He turned and looked at me with this sick, satisfied grin on his face that I'm sure I'll see in my future nightmares (I've already started... that's why I'm awake), and I nearly dropped my hand-basket. I ran. Sprinted as far away to another aisle as possible. I told my husband and he took the basket out of my hand and told me to leave and go get in the car.  I heard him laugh as I walked for the door and I saw him out of the corner of my eye, smiling. My husband paid for our things while I got in the car. I'd driven there, but my hands were shaking so bad I could barely get the key in the ignition. My husband ended up taking over, and I fell apart. I started crying, hyperventilating, and for some reason, I couldn't stop running my hands through my hair (as if to brush out the knots) repeatedly. I tried to stop but I couldn't. I was shaking so bad I thought I was having a seizure of some sort. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got home and I still couldn't calm down. My husband talked to me and helped ground me, but I still felt dirty. He ran me a bath, but I still felt covered in mud from head to toe. I kept remembering him holding me down, and how much my wrists hurt as I tried to lift my arms with his hands pushing them down. I felt just like I did when he raped me, I felt unclean. It feels bitterly unfair that I should have to feel these things when I'm the victim and have gone through enough. Even though the logical part of me knows I shouldn't, I hate myself for having the reaction I did. I wanted to be able to face him and be strong but when he did, fight or flight kicked in and well, I flew. I kept telling myself \"if you can't face him in a store, you're never going to get through court in one piece\" and I feel so weak. I feel like he victimized me again. I'm so angry with myself for being so weak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to get ready to see my folks in a couple hours, and I just can't shake this doomed feeling. This internal sense of something horrible waiting for me just around the corner. I don't know how I'm going to pretend things are okay and enjoy an early Thanksgiving when I feel so absolutely gutted. I just wish I could not be me for a little while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for the long post, I just really needed to let it out and I didn't really know where else to do it.

One of the doctors told me I can't be helped, we can only manage my pain. That *no one* can help me. I was very upset when he said that. He even said I needed to go back to work because \"Everyone has back pain.\" \n\nMy back pain started after I was moving houses and I moved some very heavy furniture. It hurt for a long time and it seems it's just gotten worse over time. It got *significantly* worse when fell at work and landed on my back on the concrete. \n\nI was forced to quit my job at a factory today because I am in so much pain I can't sleep many nights, I am hurting throughout the day. The last time I went to the doctor they put me on a new medication but pretty much did nothing else at all. They gave me another exam and tested my knee reflex and my legs barely moved at ALL which I thought was weird but they brushed over it. I was told my most recent MRI shows protrusion and degeneration but it's nothing to worry about.\n\nMy question is, should I just ditch these guys and try somewhere else?

The pain medication and physical therapy haven't helped matters much, so I spend a lot of time in pain, and I took a medical leave to try to get things fixed.

I know I didn't plan for this, it's not really my fault, but I feel like we're struggling because of me, you know? I just feel so ashamed and upset and I want to disappear. I have never quit a job before... the jobs I've had, I literally worked there till they went out of business (or in one case, burned down) or I got laid off. This is a terrible feeling. How do I handle this mentally? I have severe depression already and C-PTSD, and this is so, so not what I need on top of the horse shit that has been this year. How do I somehow be okay with this?

It started because I was being sexually abused, had severe ptsd and it felt like the only thing that I could control and the only thing that helped me feel better. \n\nI've spoken publicly about sexual abuse and  self harm and I'm not about to throw out the usual \"oh, it'll get better!\" Crap. Because sometimes it just doesn't help to hear that. Especially when you're in pain. Honestly, my pain didn't get better and *then* I stopped cutting. I stopped cutting while I was still in the deepest pit of depression I'd ever been in. \n\nI tried everything. I tried the bracelet method (where you put on a bead for every day you don't cut), I tried holding ice, I tried self harming where it wouldn't leave a mark. Nothing helped. I had gotten to the point where, over a weekend, I'd cut my leg well over 100 times and I couldn't walk. I had blood soaked towels and ended up needing medical attention. Therapy didn't help my self harming either. \n\nWhat *did* help it was literally being so *busy* that I had no time to hurt myself. After a very long time, I started to notice that on days I was very busy, I was least likely to cut. I started keeping a journal that listed all of my triggers so I could avoid them to the best of my ability. I tracked the things I did every day and I was able to go back and see what I was doing on the good days. It became a project of mine. I got a new pet, a kitten... he required a lot of attention. My old cat got sick and I cared for him as well. I began a new job. I started making repairs around my house and then I began rewarding myself at the end of every week that I succeeded in not cutting. I'd pick things that I wanted to buy myself and I'd buy them slowly as I \"earned\" them.  Eventually, I found that I'd made it *months* without cutting. I stopped rewarding myself, and eventually I stopped tracking my daily activities. I realized that I'd simply stopped thinking about hurting myself most days. I had almost trained myself to think about it at the very last. I did things that left me so tired at night (when I'd usually cut) that I simply slept. I had no energy for anything else. Months turned into years, and I'm now celebrating close to 3 years without harming myself. I can honestly say that 99% of the time, I don't think about it anymore. I returned to therapy and I learned that I needed to treat the problems *behind* why I cut. The abuse, ptsd and the depression. A lot of the time I am still severely depressed, and my ptsd is so severe it's nearly debilitating. Over time I lost the desire to cut. I replaced it with the desire for other things, such as crafting and doing all of the things I convinced myself I never had time for. I have *hundreds* of scars now, but I'm not ashamed of them. I got to a point in my life where I refused to be ashamed of my self harming. I stopped wearing layers of clothes that made it unbearably hot. I told people the truth, and somehow... their reactions were better than I ever dreamed. Eventually I had people contacting me to speak at different events to children and teenagers, and people calling me for advice. Somehow I'd turned the very worst thing I was doing to myself into a great thing I could do for others. Every time I'd talk to a kid and see the flicker of hope in their eyes at the idea that they could heal and they had nothing to be ashamed of, I wanted to cut even less. I knew that I was on the right path, and I became more determined to stay on that path.\n\nWhatever your solution is, it *is* out there, and regardless of what you might think, you *deserve* it. It might not be public speaking, it might not be keeping a journal or becoming ridiculously busy... But it is something, and you *can* find it. It takes a lot of work and it's not easy. Recovery is one of the hardest things you can do, but you are worth the work. The trick is not giving up on yourself and deciding that you're going to make it through this.\n\nI could say a bunch of empty words, but I truly believe that nobody is beyond help, and nobody *deserves* to feel the way I know *I* felt when I was hurting myself. As cliche as it seems, it *can* and *does* get better. Just hold on, find what helps you uniquely, and hold on to it. I don't post here because I simply *don't* self harm anymore, but I know that there are people out there that do for many different reasons, and sometimes it helps to hear that you're not alone and there's someone out there that believes in you and your recovery.

Now I've noticed that it does the same thing, but it has also taken all of the good feelings I *did* have. Even though I love my husband and we couldn't be more perfect together or have a better marriage, I don't feel that pull that I used to. I know that I love him, I know that I'm *in* love with him, but I can't *feel* it. Does that make sense? I can't feel love for anyone. My best friend was recently diagnosed with cancer and I've told people I'm upset, because somehow I know I am, but I can't *feel* anything. She has an aggressive form of cancer and has a very very small survival chance... and I can't feel anything in response to it. I feel cut off from everyone. I feel like I don't care, almost... but the deep, gnawing feeling that I *want* to care. I used to be such a passionate person, to an extent that was nearly exhausting... but now I don't even take pride in my artwork, which used to be a constant even when I was suicidal. I tried to step back on the medication, to wean myself off... and I spent an entire day in bed/in the bathroom with the worst headache, nausea, vomiting and violent diarrhea. I couldn't make myself keep it up. I caved and took my regular dose at my regular time. I've tried many antidepressants over the years and this is the only one that made a noticeable difference... Now it feels like I've made a mistake and was better off miserable. At least then I'd feel *something*... I haven't summoned up the courage to tell my loved ones this though I plan to tell my therapist in our next session. Could you guys offer any suggestions? Personal experiences that are similar?

My back pain is severe. I work in a factory where I have to lift heavy things and do a lot of bending, etc. I was put on medical leave for 3 weeks because I could barely get out of bed. I started PT but I've had minimal improvement. I had a follow up appointment yesterday with the doctor that reluctantly signed off on medical leave. When I went the day he signed off on it, I'd woken up with severe, tear inducing pain down the back of my neck.  My husband had to dress me. He never addressed the neck pain despite me trying to tell him repeatedly and seemed in a hurry to get me out of there. He rubbed me the wrong way but I figured maybe it was just because I was in pain and irritable. \n\nFast forward to yesterday. The PT hasn't given me a great improvement and I couldn't afford the medication he wanted to put me on, and I couldn't get in touch with his office because no matter how many voice mails I left, they never returned them. 3 weeks I tried with no luck. When I mentioned this to him he said it wasn't \"really my problem\". And proceeded to gloss over it. I brought temporary disability paperwork with me so I could get some sort of income until returning to work. He refused to prolong my medical leave or sign my disability paperwork. He said \"well, I mean... everyone has back pain so I don't see what the problem is.\" Despite having my scans that show all of the problems. He said I needed to go back to work, and me and my husband both disagreed. I can barely do anything around my house. He still refused to sign any of my paperwork so now I'm forced to try and get on personal leave (without having any money coming in bc he wouldn't sign my papers) with my job while I try to find a new doctor. If he'd signed my paperwork I could've had some money coming in while I figured out what to do next... but he seemed convinced there's nothing wrong with me. I left there in tears because I was so mad and upset. I know I am in severe pain and so does everyone around me. If my work won't grant me personal leave I have no option but to go back to work on Monday and that makes me feel just terrible but my finances are not going to allow me much wiggle room for much longer. I banked so much on him signing those papers and helping with my pain more, but to no avail. I'm sorry for the novel, but I'm just so damn upset right now.

Next step is injections I guess. Tried to go back to work and do light duty but I couldn't even do that as I work in a factory and \"light duty\" is still hellish. Finally asked to be put on medical leave. Finances aren't great due to only 1 income right now, pain medication is pretty much a joke at this point. All it does is enable me to sleep which is the only real relief I get and even that is brief. Started physical therapy but I'm not super optimistic about it. My insurance sucks so things are about to start getting really expensive. Worried I'm not gonna be able to return to my job at the end of the 12 week medical leave. Which is a shame because I'm good at my job and I have made a lot of friends there that I'll miss terribly... the job itself sucks but I do the best I can with what it is. This is on top of being diagnosed with PCOS and PTSD this year. Guess you could say 2018 hasn't been kind to me. Worried that if I can't work we won't be able to pay our bills. Just a lot of stress on top of pain that really won't relent. I'm 26. I never thought I'd be dealing with this at my age. I guess pain doesn't care how old you are or how inconvenient it is for you.

Sorry if this has been asked a million times but... I have PCOS and in the past couple of years I've noticed my hair thinning pretty bad. In places it's so bad that I have bald spots.

I would post a pic but to be honest I'm a little ashamed of it, even going as far as to wear hats most of the time. I've tried vitamins and saw no real change, so I was wondering if there's any sort of hair product or method I could use to thicken/grow my hair, or at the very least make it look like I have a ton more (without the use of extensions preferably) that you guys would recommend?

Right now money is tight as I'm on medical leave from work so it's not really feasible for me to go to the doctor for something specifically for insomnia. Is there anything you guys could suggest to help with the insomnia? What has worked for you?

I was diagnosed with PCOS in June of this year after having what turned out to be an ovarian cyst rupture at work. I was hospitalized briefly and, after 2 different ultrasounds and other tests, I was told my ovaries are like \"bubble wrap\"... they gave me pain medication and sent me on my way. I was later seen by a gynecologist who put me on Trinessa birth control. I've been on it for 2 months now and I wondered if I'd start a period... well, I did. I'm currently on it and have been for over 2 weeks. I'm bleeding very heavily and there's no sign of it stopping. I'd gladly return to my gynecologist but with my insurance I only have so many visits a year and I'm currently needing treatment for a spinal injury that's left me on medical leave from work. Obviously since I'm not at work, I can't afford to spend a lot of money right now. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what advice they could give me? I don't have much of any family and I don't really know where else to turn. I'll see my gynecologist soon if I *have* to but I would just like some advice first? It's my first post so I hope this is okay?
