I like that from the first time you boot up the game to becoming a pirate legend you have the same tools as everyone else and the only difference between players is their skill level and not their actual level.\nThat said I think it would be awesome to have more tools with which to play so that their was a little more diversity in pirates. Like what if they introduced a brutish melee weapon like an axe which hits hard but slower, and the ability instead of launching forward was swinging it in a circle, or slamming it into the ground causing an AoE attack. Or a dagger which attacked faster for less damage and the ability was to pull out your gun with your free hand and fire it. Or just get silly with it and have a handheld cannon which fires an actual cannon ball but takes forever to reload, a snake whip, or a ferryman scythe! Again I don\u2019t ever want to have to unlock access to weapons or have one weapon be vastly superior to others, I just want to run into pirates and have to fight them with different tactics then the ones I usually use, or run into pirates with different load outs and be in awe of their strategies.\nIt\u2019s a big request that I know probably couldn\u2019t happen but I\u2019ve always thought about it and wanted to share just to get it out there.
