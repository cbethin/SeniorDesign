I feel like I can\u2019t talk about it with anybody because I\u2019ve always had this crippling fear that people won\u2019t believe me, that they\u2019ll say I\u2019m lying or that I\u2019m overreacting. Maybe it\u2019s just hormones or my brain playing games with me? I\u2019m scared that if I go seek help, that they will tell me, \u201cThere is nothing wrong, you\u2019re just overreacting\u201d. I\u2019m scared of the embarrassment that will cause me.\n\nA few years ago I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Ever since then I haven\u2019t had anybody to rely on. When my parents talk with my siblings they talk about how thing are going and about their life, but when they talk with me it\u2019s ALWAYS about my diabetes, that I will never be able to get rid of. I don\u2019t feel like I have a relationship with my parents. When they make jokes, it offends me (they don\u2019t know) and when they leave me alone in my room for hours on end I feel like I\u2019m truly alone.\n\nI\u2019ve never had real friends. For the longest time I would make a \u2018friend\u2019 then they would leave. I have never fit in anywhere. I\u2019ve recently made new friends (we\u2019ve been friends for 3 years now). I still don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s real. When we walk on the school grounds I stay in the back of the group and debate what I should write in my suicide letter. I have done this for the past few months. Not constantly though. It comes and goes. Every time I think it\u2019s gone and I\u2019m happy again it comes back harder, stronger, worse.\n\nMy school life is toxic. My class is a toxic mess of negative emotions. Someone will say something like \u201cI\u2019m gonna go die in a hole\u201d and someone will respond \u201csame\u201d or they will point and laugh (not in a mocking way but in a way showing that they relate)\n\nLast year was the peak of my life. I did good in school, I won the art award, my friends felt real, but that all disappeared. I don\u2019t want to do anything anymore and I feel like I have no future.   There is nothing that interests me enough. I keep disappointing myself. \n\nWhenever I feel like I want to kill myself or I want to harm myself I feel like it\u2019s because I want attention not because something is wrong. I keep trying to distract myself from it. Trying to keep reality out. I\u2019m scared that those distractions might turn into bad habits.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that this is so long. I\u2019m just so tired and I wanted to get this off my chest. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling or why I comes and goes. I\u2019ve done countless quizzes (I know this things aren\u2019t really accurate, but it\u2019s all I have) but I don\u2019t know.\n\nSorry for this long rant.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 407750, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don\u2019t know", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9yvecr/i_dont_know/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "Alice-three-times", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2bzwo1o4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542037718, "domain": "self.facts", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/facts/comments/9wf3qa/yesterday_11_november_was_the_100th_anniversary/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wf3qa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/facts/comments/9wf3qa/yesterday_11_november_was_the_100th_anniversary/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1542037718, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "facts", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiu7", "subreddit_subscribers": 14076, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Yesterday (11 November) was the 100th anniversary of the ending of WW1", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/facts/comments/9wf3qa/yesterday_11_november_was_the_100th_anniversary/"}]}
