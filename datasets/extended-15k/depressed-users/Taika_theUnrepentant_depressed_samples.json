We then had a somewhat brief conversation about why he thought that. One of the reasons was the symptom of having \"issues with identity.\" He said this could be defined as unstable self-identity and self-image. I started crying again when the doctor said this because this describes me to a tee. In recent years, I feel that I completely lack an identity. Don't get me wrong, I have things like a name, a birth date, and phone number, but I have no clue what makes me \"me.\" Everyday is a brand new identity crisis and it doesn't help that I'm at that age where I'm expected by society to pick a job, pick a partner, and think about settling down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm NOT asking for a diagnosis on here, HOWEVER, I am asking for ways to cope with my feelings a lack of identity and very unstable self-image. I'm sorry this post is so long, but I'm not sure where to turn to. I'm in between psychiatrists (I finally get to see a brand new one in a few days), as well looking for a new therapist (the one I had been seeing for a couple years passed away unexpectedly last January).

I recently started cutting again for the first time since high school. I've been working a summer job at a popular car rental company at a regional airport in a medium-sized Midwestern city. My coworkers and managers have noticed a steep decline in my mental health situation as well as the wounds on my arm. At first I didn't care about covering my arms since it's August and I predominantly work outside with the cars, but now my self-harm arm is looking more and more gruesome and people are beginning to worry. I don't mind them worrying a little bit, but now one of the managers is getting is starting to get on my case to the point where I'm worried that she might order a welfare check from the police. I had two of the airport sheriff's deputies come talk to me yesterday at work about my (supposed) reckless driving, but when approached me, I was terrified that they might be there to lecture me about my mental health. I did my best to not draw attention to my arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo any of you know if the police will actually come for a welfare check based on someone's self harm scars? I was caught off guard by two police officers from my university conducting a welfare check on me last semester. They were sent there by a group of friends who thought I was talking suicidal one night. The officers kept asking me to go to the hospital, but I didn't. I'm worried that I'll be forced to go to the hospital this time around because of my obvious self-harm wounds.\n\n Does anyone know if the authorities can force you to go to the hospital? I'm so scared now. I can't go back to the psych ward. I'd rather die that end up back there.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "selfharm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm6q", "subreddit_subscribers": 15725, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Police welfare check?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/9a48ns/police_welfare_check/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
