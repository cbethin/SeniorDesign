There were times I didn't want to live. I was suicidal for about 2 years. I imagined my roommate finding my dead body in the bathroom and only saying \"goddamnit\", thousands of time. The only reason I am still alive is probably my mother. I know she would kill herself too if I'd die. And even the thought about my mother getting the news that I am dead was, and still is, tearing me apart. The good thing about a chronic depression is that hard times aren't as hard with a heavy manic depression. The bad thing is there are no good times. Everything is grey, always. \n\nWhen I was diagnosed I read a lot of stuff about depression. A lot of stuff made my angry. People glorifying the mental illness for a stylish videos. Movies about depression, telling a story about a depressed boy and when he meets a cute girl, he's suddenly healed, because hey he's in love (fuck you It's a kind of funny story). \n\nBut once I saw a video about a girl describing her depression and it was like she was talking right to me. She said that she doesn't hate herself. She doesn't need to be punished, therefore she doesn't feel like cutting herself (I know it is not the only reason people cut themselves). The only reason why she is suicidal is that she wants it to stop. The feeling. The feeling that something bad is about to happen. Without a reason. You know the feeling when you're sitting in a room waiting to write the most important test in your life? The feeling when your girlfriend texts you \"we need to talk\"? This feeling. Every fucking minute of my life, without a cause. I just wanted it to stop. And after the worst 4 years of my life, it stopped.\n\nI saw the abyss. And I survived it. I wish I could tell you something like how I managed to deal with my illness and how   \nI changed my life to a better. The thing is I didn't do much. Life changed. I changed. My point is that 2 years ago I thought I will be like that the rest of my life. I'm not 100% healed. I still need a very stable surrounding and can't leave my social environment for more than 2 weeks, but I feel so much better. I still have a few bad days, but they are much more endurable since I have mostly good days. \n\nWhat I want to say: don't give up! Live can change so fast and so can you. You are strong, very strong indeed. Even if you don't think otherwise. You are stronger than any of these entrepreneur fucktards posting shit on instagram. You are still here! And that deserves way more respect than a champions league football player scoring 5 goals in a match. There is a monster in our head that is trying to kill us. Everyday. Every minute. But yet we are still here. Don't let the monster win.

Im in therapy for 2 years now. About 14 months ago I started to feel a lot better. I moved to a new apartment and made some new friendships and cutted some toxic ones. The Summer last year I finally was able to feel joy again. I had a very stable social environment and felt very self confident. So I thought I finally beaten my depression.   \n\n\nSo in my studies we have to do a foreign internship for 4 months. So I moved to Switzerland last sunday. I thought it would be a great opportunity to meet new people, discover a new city (never really moved out from my hometown) and get some great practical work experience. Its the third day and it already felt like an eternity. My job is kinda boring, since I have no actual tasks, so everything I do all day is grind reddit. I work from 08:30 am to 05:00 pm so after work I dont have the energy to do anything but drive straight home and watch a series (even going to the grocery store really exhausts me). This all wouldn't be a problem if a had nice coworkers or if I had any coworkers. I work in a huge office, which is nearly empty. Only my supervisor and another guy are here (both over 50 so not really easy for me to make friends with since I am 22). Sometimes I am completely alone in the office. It feels like freaking isolation.\n\nI feel like something is changing in me. It feels like a monster i locked away is rumbling in his cage and the lock is about to break. I dont want to get ill again, it took so much to throw the monster in a cage and I dont know if i could lock him away a second time. Last night was a mixture of mutely screaming and trying to cry. I'm afraid.\n\nLast year I made a principle for myself: mental health over everything. If somethings not good for me I quit it. But it would be such a huge step to abort this internship. Maybe I could talk to my university and tell them that I cant leave my home, because I need therapy. But that would be the easy part of quitting. Im more afraid of everybody asking why I quit and why I am already back. I told about 5 friends + my parents that I have a depression.  \nAnd I cant get loose of the thought that it would be cowardly and weak. Especially because I think about quitting after 2 days (Wtf is wrong with me).\n\n And what if my university wont show understanding for my situation? Will this means that I cant finish my studies? Boy it feels so devastating to realize that I only locked away the monster instead of killing it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 392323, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I really need advice for my current situation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9l05h2/i_really_need_advice_for_my_current_situation/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "beowar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_25ji4i5", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538490889, "domain": "self.gameofthrones", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/9kr51l/no_spoilers_the_world_of_westeros_series_from/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9kr51l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "s-none", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "No Spoilers", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/gameofthrones/comments/9kr51l/no_spoilers_the_world_of_westeros_series_from/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "NBO0L0IzJ_tpBzMVsIpU9thrnf4Fx7MnAueMBcBtiSY", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9HbTivulrvFCabQQ-dN6HrRs2y4gqoOwdHAwyXQAUCc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=5b8d6d9d9927f3c93a7191b0b5645231", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9HbTivulrvFCabQQ-dN6HrRs2y4gqoOwdHAwyXQAUCc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=086ea9b44eeedf4a95623ecfc78f5aeb", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9HbTivulrvFCabQQ-dN6HrRs2y4gqoOwdHAwyXQAUCc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=eb6143af6444262b5fd2a93de2c7c7ad", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9HbTivulrvFCabQQ-dN6HrRs2y4gqoOwdHAwyXQAUCc.jpg?s=94cd4b39d6313595c6062b4f788f43b6", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538490890, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nso the german Youtubers Cinema Strikes Back started a Videoseries where they present Cities from the ASOIAF Universe with a lot of interesting informations and exclusive material from the official GoT VFX-Team.
