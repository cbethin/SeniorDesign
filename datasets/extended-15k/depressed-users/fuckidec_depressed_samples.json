Had my stomach pumped, said it was an accident (lol?) given a shrink who couldn\u2019t remember my name. Got rid of her and moved on. I\u2019ve tried three times since.\n\nI\u2019ve been depressed since I started middle school. What is that, like 10, 11 years old? I know the stigma of pubescent teens. This wasn\u2019t like that. It was angry and scary. Nothing has changed since. \n\nI\u2019m 22 now. I\u2019ve refused treatment, I haven\u2019t seen a psychiatrist about my anxiety or depression since the first time. I don\u2019t have panic attacks anymore but I still have the thoughts. Suicidal ideation. Panic breathing (although it stopped escalating to panic attacks). The spiraling. The anger.\n\nI just get this fucking rage now. Like I wanna burn everything and everyone around me down and then stomp on the ashes. I know it\u2019s not okay, I just don\u2019t want to be medicated. I don\u2019t even know what it is. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder, clinical depressive disorder and acute ocd. I\u2019m just not sure if I should balls up and go see somebody about this rage. \n\nI was never medicated because I want to be strong enough to fix it myself. I\u2019m a nursing student, I KNOW that\u2019s not how it works. I just don\u2019t know who to see, how it works or if I can even afford it. I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t like to self-diagnose and I\u2019m not going to get into the details but I\u2019m afraid I might have bpd. Nobody would listen to me in the past. I was a kid. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting this.
