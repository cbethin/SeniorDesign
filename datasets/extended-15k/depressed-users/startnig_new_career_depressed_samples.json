I am working on my master thesis right now and I don't have anything else (no school subjects).\n\nI would like to move to Dublin and try to find job there. I would like to get hired with one the Big 4 companies. I have worked for well known Linux oriented company for 3 years. \n\nAnd here comes my questions - should I actually study before the interviews/applications? I remember a lot of from subjects such as algorithms or some design patterns, but this knowledge is rather dusty. \n\nShould I apply as a graduate or seek for non-grad positions? Despite the fact that I have worked for 3 years, I don't have any big projects done. I mostly worked on fixing various bugs/errors or implementing minor features. I was really all-arounder, so I could fix CI/CD configuration, write some tests or just implement new functionality.\n\nThank you for your replies guys.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "subreddit_subscribers": 175336, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What should you do in my shoes?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9fhlxq/what_should_you_do_in_my_shoes/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
