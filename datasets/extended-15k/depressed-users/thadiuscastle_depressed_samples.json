The entire room will light up as soon as I step foot in the door. However, the person that radiates happiness is not the same person behind closed doors. That guy that makes everyone laugh and is always smiling has a disease. For the past 5 years, I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. \n\nTwo and a half years ago, I graduated college. After graduation, I was able to find a full time job in my field. I recently discovered the term \"high functioning depression\" and I can't think of a better way to describe my day to day. I wanted to share my story with you all.\n\nI currently have a 5 month streak going where I have not called in because I felt shit. When my depression was at its worst, I would call in at least once a week because I physically could not get out of bed. It got so bad, I almost lost my job and I exhausted all my vacation days and sick days. I still have some really bad days, but the number of days I feel like a functional adult drastically outnumber my shitty days. This was not always the case. After seeking some help, finding the right medication and addressing other issues I have been ignoring, I feel like I am \"highly functional\". However, I continue to have this weight on my shoulders named Depression. \n\nThe past 2 and a half years (the time I started working full time) have flown by because it seemed like I am just living day to day without much going on. My days were so monotonous; work, sleep, chores, video games, repeat. It definitely felt like something was missing in my life. I needed to do something more with my day because I felt like a robot doing the same thing day in and day out.  \n\nRecently, I started working for the school district in my area. Although I work as a scientist, I think I have discovered a passion for working with students. I will happily work 8 hours for the district in the morning and then work for another 8 hours in the afternoon at my full time job. The 8 hours I work for the district don't seem like work to me; they seem to be more like a hobby. I think I do this to keep myself busy. Students have the biggest smiles on their faces when they see me walking in the hallways. I feel like a celebrity because everyone knows my name (staff, students, administrators.) I get some sort of rush from teaching students. But what really does it for me is when I hear students say \"I get it!\" Hearing those words just make me happy. It's funny though because the person these kids see walking through the halls was crying themselves to sleep the night before. But, I wake up every morning and put my mask on to hide this disease. These kids, or really anyone in my life, would never guess I am depressed unless I explicitly told them.   \n\nThe days I don't work for the district, I end up lounging around my apartment for hours not really doing anything until my shift at my lab starts. Although my days are super long when I work both jobs, I enjoy what I do. When I get home, I'm exhausted but its not a depression exhausted. I'm ready to go to bed because I feel like I earned my rest for the night. At my worst, I would sleep for 16 hours straight. I was tired of sleeping, so I would sleep some more. It was a vicious cycle. Plus, the extra income from the school district isn't too bad either. \n\nI am sharing this to let you all know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Depression fucking sucks. What helps me with this is to do something. Anything! (I know, easier said than done.) Try and find something you enjoy, no matter how big or small. Things will get better, I promise!!!", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 403449, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Shoutout to all of you diagnosed with Depression but doing your best everyday", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9vcgd7/shoutout_to_all_of_you_diagnosed_with_depression/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
