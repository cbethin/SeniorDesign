I'm very confused as I'm writing this but I won't edit it for it to remain genuine. This is very strange to recall. As far as I remember, I thought that maybe I had gone through some trauma in my childhood that I didn't remember because I had noticed that, whenever I'm punched or hit without reason (even if it's joking), I get incredibly mad and I hardly control myself. There were some moments that I couldn't remember, like half a day in school that was completely blank and when I went outside for buying something. \n\nDamn, as I write this, it sounds ridiculous.\n\nBut yeah, that's the truth.

She noticed it, and we hugged. We had our faces very close, and in a whim, I almost kissed her. She stepped back shocked and so did I. I felt so embarrassed, because she's my friend, I can't ruin it with something like that. It doesn't help that I have never had a girlfriend before, not even kissed someone.

I left her at her house, and I went walking to mine, at the other side of the town. When I was walking along the highway, I was so tired that I had to sit down. I wanted to jump in front of the vehicles. I tried to call all of my friends except for the girl that was with me before.

I don't want to. \n\nI had a dream two months ago. I don't have nightmares, it's usually just weird things and nonsense. However, that night I dreamed about a boy lost in the woods. Clear skies, around 3:00 P.M., open spaces, it didn't trigger fear in me at all. The boy found a necklace hanging in a branch of a tree. You know, you can't read things in dreams, so I didn't know what it had written on it. The boy started running through the forest. Still, no fear. When I woke up, I was just confused as hell.\n\nI told Mark the whole thing. He confessed that he had a similar dream two months ago. That one was about a girl crawling through a maintenance tunnel under our school. There was loud music, and the girl seemed to have been looking for something. Suddenly, she passed out, probably due to lack of oxygen. Mark didn't remember\n\ni will not rest\n\nthe rest.\n\nSix months ago, I received a letter. Whoever sent it, their name wasn't written on it. It called me a killer, that they knew what I had done, and they would catch me soon. I have never killed anyone, hell, I don't think I ever hurt anyone physically. The PDI (The chilean equivalent of the FBI) investigated my case, but they told me that there wasn't much to do since the letter was found in a mail box. \n\nBut it wasn't the only letter. In the next weeks, I found more EVERYWHERE. In my backpack, in my chair, between the pages of my notebook, they were stalking me at high school too! I started analyzing if the handwriting corresponded to any of my classmates, but I didn't have luck. \n\nThe letters now called me an arsonist, a rapist, a torturer. Fuck, I don't even remember everything I was called. But the person sending the letters really hated me. \n\nBut it wasn't until one month ago that I realized the connection between our dreams and the letters. My Facebook account notified me about a post that I had saved but not watched. I never save posts, so I knew something was wrong. \n\nIt wasn't one post, there were three of them! The first one was from Mark's account. It was a video of him and his childhood \"girlfriend\" playing in a forest. I immediately realized it, the dream was about Mark in the forest. But there was a big \"plot hole\" in reality: Mark would have remembered when I told him about my dream. And what happened to his \"girlfriend\"? \n\nAfter watching the first video, I had to take a shower so I could relax after that much stress. When I came back, there was a document written on the screen of my laptop.\n\n\"I DONT WANT CLOSUR NO MORE\"\n\nWhat the hell was going on? I had to call Mark. But he didn't answer. All I got was his voicemail. \"Hey, I'm Mark, so... if you got something important to say, keep calling until I answer, okay? If you don't, just leave a message\".\n\nI was desperate, so I kept calling. The same voicemail over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. \n\nHe didn't answer, but my last call sent chills through my spine. \"Mark is not here anymore. There was a tower in the outskirts, but of course you knew that. Killer.\"\n\nI remembered seeing a tower in the desert north of my town. It was very old, I never went close to it. \n\nI didn't want to keep calling, and I didn't want to go to his house. Whoever left the letters, and changed the voicemail, was definitely there. Instead, I called the police and explained the situation the \n\nthere's not darkness anymore. I see you now. Blood will be remembered.\n\nbest I could.\n\nI felt the need to watch the second video, to try and understand what was even going on.\n\nIt was from Katherine's account.\n\n\"Fuck\" was all I could think. The video loaded, and I saw a girl being chased through the school hallways. The others students completely ignored her, probably thinking that she was playing. But I knew it, she was terrified. She ran to the playground, and jumped into the maintenance tunnel. Whoever was chasing her, they were the ones filming. \n\nI knew it had to be Katherine. If the person behind this was close to Mark's house because of the voicemail changing, then Katherine should be alright at her home. I ran to her home and used the public transport to get before the mystery person. I knocked on the door, with a knife in my pocket if things were to go worse.\n\nKatherine opened the door for me. I had to hug her, knowing that she was the next one. I couldn't leave her. She asked me what was happening, and I had to explain it all. She seemed to not believe me at first, but she accepted to stay in her older sister's apartment for the time being due to my insistence.\n\nI had to investigate the tower. In my way to the desert, I looked around every corner before walking again. They could be behind me. They could be ahead of me. They could be walking by my side. They could be anyone in the streets.\n\nAs I left town, I received a call from my parents. They told me that they were being held for questioning due to all the crazy shit that had happened the last months and I had reported to the police. The police had sent an officer to my house, but I wasn't there. I told them that I was going to the tower in the desert, because the voicemail told me so. I agreed to have an officer watching from a distance. \n\nAs soon as the call ended, I received another one. It was from Mark's phone.\n\n\"The tower was an amazing place. Shame it's all burnt down today. Remember me now?\"\n\nThe voice was heavily distorted and I couldn't guess who it was, but it definitely wasn't Mark. They had his phone, they probably left the house with it. That meant that they could have went to Katherine's house even sooner. They were just playing with me, they wanted to see me afraid and scared.\n\nI got to the entrance of the tower. It was getting cold. As soon as I passed through the doors, I remembered that there was a third video. \"It must have been about me\" I thought. And if it was something I couldn't remember and is important, I was screwed up. \n\nKiller... I'm not a killer. So why was I targeted? Was it a psycho? \n\nI looked around the inside of the tower. Most of the wooden stairs were reduced to ashes, and the walls had cracks from top to bottom. I felt watched, but there was nothing I could do about it. Screaming would have only made it worse. \n\nThere was a photo in the center of the tower. It was Mark, Katherine and I. The photo was taken in the very same tower, before being damaged by the fire. I knew it, something had totally messed up my memory. I didn't know I had entered the tower at all.\n\nSomething caught my eye. It was a little kid, sitting behind us in the photo. I had never seen that kid before \n\nyou shouldnt. Life is death. Dana was chosen. You werent. Who are you anyway\n\nin my life. The kid had blood in his forehead, and was wearing a red hood. \n\nMark had dirt on his right cheek, and was wearing the same necklace I saw in my dream. Now, I could read what was written on it. \"Dana\". It was his girlfriend's name. \n\nKatherine had a red line in her skin around her neck. Her eyes were staring at the camera, almost soulless. Dirty hair, and she looked like she hadn't brushed her teeth in weeks. \n\nI had a big cut over the left side of my face. My hands had signs of having been cuffed some time ago. I looked like if I was shaking. \n\nI didn't remember any of that. \n\nI \n\nI\n\nI\n\nI looked at the back of the photo, which had another letter written. \"NOVMBER 2007. UR TH LAST ONE\".\n\nOverwhelmed by everything, I ran away from the tower, taking the photo with me. That night, I looked at the date of the videos. They all were filmed and published in October 2008. I received the news about Mark. He was in a very critical state in the hospital after being stabbed six times in the stomach. He would be sent to another city with a better hospital.\n\nhow could you. Stop. Next one and you know it\n\nI showed the photo to the PDI and they told me that they were going to analyze it. It calmed me down a little bit, but that wasn't enough to prepare me for another night. \n\nI was completely paranoid. Even though an officer was guarding my home, and my parents were awake, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched from inside my room. I couldn't remember the red hooded kid. Damn, I didn't even know Katherine had tried to kill herself. All I could remember from November 2007 was that I had a party with my friends in the beach, and maybe I only recalled that because I usually don't get invited to parties. Nothing else. \n\nThey weren't in my room, but I knew they were watching me. After calling Katherine and making sure she was okay, I decided to watch the third video. From my own account. Also published in October 2008. \n\nIt was me as a kid, walking in the hallways of a hospital. And there he was. The red hooded kid. He was watching me from the window of a locked room. I didn't see him. I just kept walking and I\n\nwhy do you keep on. Leave it now. No mercy anymore \n\nwalked into a weird man. He was around 30 years old. I apparently talked to him, but the audio was completely cut off beyond that point. He took a knife from his pocket and proceeded to to slash my face. I fell to the floor, and he stared at the camera smiling. He was smiling. He was happy. He was nobody. He was watching. He was\n\nI'm sorry, this is taking too long. My screen has glitched a couple of times since I started writing. But I need to share this.\n\nCompletely terrified of the video, I sent it to the police. The day after that, they told me that it wasn't tampered with it in any way.\n\nI tried to sleep, but I saw his eyes in the dark. I saw his eyes through the curtains. He was still smiling at a desperate me. He was everywhere. He obviously enjoyed watching me suffer. \n\nI forced myself to attend high school the next day. I spent the whole day with Katherine. A photo was sent to her phone through Bluetooth during a break. It was taken from inside our very classroom. He was hiding in the storage room, but when we checked it, he was already gone.\n\nI see his smile every time I close my eyes. \n\nTwo weeks ago, after suffering from severe paranoia and not making progress at all with the situation, I found a document printed on the back of a worksheet. It was from a mental hospital, and I knew what it was leading to.\n\n\"February 2009. Patients ------------------ [me], Mark --------- and Katherine ---------------- were discharged today. The medication seems to work as long as they take it at exactly the same hour. At this rate, they will no longer need the medication after January 2010. Katherine -------------- is in a better state than the others. Suicidal thoughts are almost completely gone. Mark ------------- suffers from recurrent nightmares that seem to mirror the incident in which Katherine ---------------- almost died in the maintenance tunnel looking for her antidepressants. However, -------------- said yesterday that a photo of the desert tower was glued to the window. He thinks that the 'Smiling Man' wants them to go back to the tower where they were attacked the first time. We think that the traumatic experience may show up in dreams for the next years, but the medication should be enough to block the memories. For now, we will keep looking for the 'Smiling Man' file in our database, in case he was in here in the past.\"\n\nThe \"Smiling Man\" sent us three to the mental hospital. Shit, I immediately thought that it was the same person stalking me now. Why us? What did we do? \n\n\"Killer\". \"Arsonist\". \"Torturer\". \n\nI didn't do any of that. If I did, I wouldn't have been sent back home from the mental hospital. The Smiling Man was totally crazy. \n\nI confronted my parents about that. They told me the whole truth. \n\nMark, Katherine and me were found in an alley in the downtown. There was a photo of us three in the tower, and the Smiling Man looking down at us from behind. There was a mirror, and the red hooded kid could be seen taking the photo. \n\nThe police didn't find anyone that looked like the Smiling Man in the database. They concluded that it was someone wearing heavy make up or a realistic mask to disguise their true face. \n\nHowever, after they found us, we tried to live our normal lives. Katherine was on antidepressants and Mark only had nightmares, but I always saw the Smiling Man everywhere. Eventually, Katherine attempted suicide, so all of us were brought to the mental hospital as a precautionary measure.\n\nWe were discharged in September 2008. But it wasn't over, because the Smiling Man was chasing us. October 2008, we went missing one by one. First, Mark. He was last seen in the forest next to the highway. Second, Katherine. She entered the school's maintenance tunnel after being supposedly chased by the Smiling Man in our school, but she didn't go out. Third, me. I escaped from my house and went to the old hospital. Witnesses saw me enter but not come back. \n\nI realized that it was then when the three videos were filmed. \n\ni told you to stop. Dont listen to him no more \n\nHowever, we were apparently brought to the tower again. We were tortured non-stop for two days. That's when the photo found in the tower was taken. The Smiling Man released us with a note saying that we will suffer even more now. The mental hospital immediately took care of us, until February 2009. As of december of the same year, we had our memories completely blocked. We were able to have a normal life.\n\nI woke up in my room. I saw his smile through a crack in the ceiling. It was completely dark, and his smile was the only thing that I could see clearly. I don't want this. I wanted to kill myself at that point.\n\nImagine it. Alone in a dark room. You can't see anything. And suddenly, a white line of teeth appears in the darkness. It's a smile. You can't see their face, but you know who it is. That's how I felt that night.\n\nim sorry for it all. It was danas fault\n\nyou know, they didnt hav to get involved. It was their fault \n\nWhen I woke up the next day, I had another letter in the windowsill. \"I'm always watching. Blame him, not me.\"\n\nTwo days ago, Katherine called me. She said that she found a letter. She read it for me. \"I'll accept your innocence. Time to move on. You know who's next. Join me in the tower.\"\n\nThe man had spared Katherine. But I knew who was next. It was me. The paranoia grew inside of me again. I won't go back to that tower. \n\nI forgot to write something. I remember that, years ago, Mark's childhood girlfriend Dana disappeared in the woods, after being expelled from school due to beating up a kid because of an argument. No one ever found her. Now I get it, she was the original target. \"Time to move on\". The Smiling Man has been moving on from one target to another. First, Dana. Next, her boyfriend, Mark. Then, Mark's closest friend, Katherine (But somehow, he spared her. She probably didn't know about Dana anyway, so she was \"forgiven\"). But I investigated too much. The Smiling Man was coming after me now. \n\nwhy dont you stop\n\nI know way too much. That psycho probably thinks that Mark and I helped Dana or something. That kid... The red hooded kid.\n\nIs there anything worse than a crazy man trying to avenge the harm that his \"son\" received?\n\nNow I close my eyes, I have nowhere to go. My parents are here in the house, but I know that the Smiling Man will sneak inside somehow.

Fuck, nothing bad has to happen at all. All of a sudden I go down and I stay like that. \n\nToday was different. I got around of 10:00 A.M. without feeling down, and then everything went downhill. I'm horrible at pretending that I'm okay, so I naturally get everyone mad at me because of being a jerk to them. I stayed like that until 2:00 P.M., when I had a small argument with my friend... If I can call her that. I started thinking that nobody needs me anymore, that my friends are sick of me and that I HAD to kill myself. It's been almost ten hours and the only thing that has changed is that I can at least walk. I spent from 5:00 to 8:00 laying in my bed, barely moving.\n\nI don't want to go back to high school tomorrow. I KNOW that I will end up feeling like shit. I haven't gotten an appointment with a psychiatric so I still don't have my antidepressants and I don't know if I will make it beyond this month. Suicidal thoughts have been all over my head since years ago. Today they got worse.
