Maybe some of you will feel like reading it and responding. Will try to keep it as short as I can, don't want you to feel like you wasted your time when you come to the conclusion of the post. Actually, I will write what the conclusion will be so you have an image. I want your opinion on if I'm depressed (I was diagnosed with light depression but it might've not been right) or just extremely lazy or something else.   \nSo, just a quick info about me, I'm 20 years old. I mean, I hit it just today on 14th of November. I graduated high school on april this year but haven't gone further with education, even though I was supposed to. Since april I'm doing... well, nothing. Not working, just sitting home and wasting my life because I'm too scared of working to find a work and go to it.  \nNow to the completely chaotic thoughts, I don't even know how to start. I know that posting here won't really change anything in my life and I have only myself to blame for that. I imagined it for a few days before doing it, I believe everyone does imagine what the answer will be before posting somewhere, and I came to realisation that whatever will it be, I will always tell myself the same thing. If I see that someone has similiar thoughts to me and supports me, I'll just convince myself that it's not true (over time). And if someone states that I'm just lazy and I should do something with my life instead of poisoning the existance of my parents and everyone around me I'll accept that but still do nothing with it. Just feel worse and worse, like I want to make myself feel worse.  \nEh, feels like I'm describing my whole life here. I don't feel suicidal. I'm scared to commit suicide in any possible way but, on the other hand, I don't care about my life and the quality of it. I don't seem to be scared with the fact that I might become homeless or something. Llike someone on this subreddit already mentioned, I'm dreaming of success but have no motivation to even start trying to achieve it, even while having a pretty good life compared to others. I realise that \"compared to others\" isn't a good argument in terms of mental illness but nonetheless it doesn't comfort me and I still value myself by that. It's not like I don't have people around. I have a girlfriend that loves me, I have a close friend. These two people are close to me, I know they'd do a lot for me and I'm not scared to lose them. I'm not terribly bad looking or something. I pretty much have everything that a person in a truly bad situation doesn't have  and still I can't appreciate it like I should. I still tend to be moody and choosy, even though I'm in no position to do that. I live in a fantasy world of my own imagination and wish I could be there instead of here. Every little mistake or a bad opinion causes me to hurt, especially if I get into an argument because pride and stuff. Every good thing, a success, just flows by because I convince myself that these are fake or just not right.   \n\n\nWell, I probably could write a lot more about that (and I imagined writing a lot more of what's inside me) but you'd probably fall asleep half way through and I also start repeating myself over and over again. Am I lazy and just a terrible person?
