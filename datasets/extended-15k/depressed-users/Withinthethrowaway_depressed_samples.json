I'm a 26 year old who has absolutely no one in my life. I've been this way since about 4 years ago when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it seems to drive people away. I'm not the perfect person people want in a friend and it hurts. I'm not putting the blame solely on others because I know deep down who wants to associate with someone who doesn't love themselves. I feel so alone and everyone I had in my life has gone. I don't socialize very often because I work from home, but to supplement that I got involved in online gaming in a very popular MMORPG and made some friends there for a bit. But as always, I pushed them away and I considered them my very close friends who meant a lot to me. I'm scared because I know if this continues to go this way, I won't survive another year. I spent my birthday last Sunday alone and crying all day because I didn't even hear from my sisters. I feel so worthless and I'm ashamed of how my life has been so far. I've struggled every day to not just jump in front of a car or take too many pills and hope it ends. I just want to be happy but I honestly don't know if it's possible anymore. I've felt this way for so long I'm not sure what happiness is.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 396227, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I feel so alone with no one around me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9o8pby/i_feel_so_alone_with_no_one_around_me/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Withinthethrowaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1415678874, "domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2lxlbg/suicide_seems_logical_at_this_point/", "id": "2lxlbg", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2lxlbg/suicide_seems_logical_at_this_point/", "retrieved_on": 1441077057, "score": 1, "selftext": "I don't know how to feel anymore, as cliche as that sounds. I seem to cause more grief and pain than any other emotion to the people I love. I know they love me too, but there is a strain I put on them and I can tell they're growing further and further from me. I just want my family to be happy and I just think without me they truly would have the chance. I've made huge fuck ups in life, and I think I've had my peak already early on, I'm only 22, but I can't deal waking up every day just waiting for the day to be over. I can't enjoy life living like this.. And I don't know if anyone will read this but I feel somewhat better after putting this out there.
