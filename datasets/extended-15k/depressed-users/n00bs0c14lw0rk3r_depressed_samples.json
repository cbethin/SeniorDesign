I am a social work intern and work with children in foster care so I see and hear a lot of disturbing things. This has unfortunately been somewhat difficult for me as it has brought up things that I've ignored for a very long time. I have a history of childhood abuse and it is starting to affect me. I am hyper-vigilant and can't help but feel suspicious towards some of the biological parents. That said, I've tried to get therapy before but hated to person I was matched with. The first session was ok but the second session was a conversation that centered mostly around the therapist and her family (mostly her grandchildren). I realize I sound selfish but therapy isn't cheap and I'm there to talk about my issues, not to listen to someone tell me about how adorable their grandkids are! LOL! After I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety I decided to get help again. This time, my doctor linked me with their psychologists in their behavioral unit. Unfortunately, the first session ended with me getting a list of outside resources because apparently they don't offer long term therapy and my issues are too extensive for short term therapy. Why is it so hard to find help?!?! It's already hard enough to admit that I need help and attempt to talk about my past and now I have to find another therapist.
