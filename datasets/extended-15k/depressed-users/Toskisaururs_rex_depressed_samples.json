:/\nI\u2019m 17 and I\u2019m going trough a really severe depression for five years, but started taking meds January, I have some anger issues too, but they are easier to deal with, also I ha e a history of self harm and suicide attempts. But I\u2019m trying my hardest to feel better and improve every day :)      \nSo I\u2019m asking for a little help because I don\u2019t know if they are being abusive or not. \nMy parents have always had some weird behaviors, but I never thought of them being narcissistic. First there\u2019s my mom, sometimes she\u2019s really caring and kind, but in the majority of the time she\u2019ll demand me to do things, scream at me for not helping enough (even tough I do everything she asks), stalk me on social media and look at my conversations with friends on my phone (if I change my password she\u2019ll take it from me until I tell her), when I was a kid, she\u2019d prohibit me from watching any cartoon that she didn\u2019t like, I also had a big love for stuffed animals, and when I disobeyed her, she\u2019d just rip them apart. Now she denies everything and say I just had a weird imagination, she also likes to say that I\u2019m depressed because I want to confront  her or because I don\u2019t have any religion etc( typical stuff). She also likes to criticize me in any given opportunity, or make me feel extremely guilty for making her buy me meds and pay for my therapies and even for my school...\nAnd then there\u2019s my dad, he\u2019s more passive then mom,like, he doesn\u2019t say everything he thinks, but he\u2019s way more aggressive physically, one time I had a stitches in my leg and he got mad for some reason so he kicked me  right in my injured leg opening one of the stitches. And since my depression started 5 years ago, and my grades started to get worse he just stopped talking to me, and now he just look at me to call me stupid or scream. And mom does nothing because he\u2019s the father and because of that he\u2019s in his right to treat me like trash. \nThe worse is: they can\u2019t admit what they do to me, and when I tell my psychiatrist about everything, my parents tell him that I\u2019m lying, and he just agrees with them ( I don\u2019t know why)\nAnd even though I had improved my grades they don\u2019t seem happy about it. I just want a bit of love and recognition      ;-; ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "subreddit_subscribers": 302127, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Am I a bad daughter?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9lgkty/am_i_a_bad_daughter/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
