It's not just thinking about stuff but actually doing them instantly. You can make impulsive decisions ,you can do certain things which you know is going to harm you but you do them anyway just because you had a thought about it.\n\n&gt;*Being Impulsive , feels like being a slave to your brain.*\n\nIt's as if whatever your brain demands or wishes you have to fulfill it , you don't think about it being correct or incorrect or its consequences.\n\nYou might be wondering that brain and thoughts can be controlled , but no that's the thing , when you are this impulsive then you don't have any control over yourself , it's the worst feeling when you feel helpless about this control.\n\nWhen you are depressed plus you are of impulsive nature , it turns out to be a bad combination because depression leads you mostly towards negative thoughts and then as your impulsive nature is you actually go for those negative instincts. Self harming , anger issues , frustration are all outcomes of your impulsive nature.\n\nMy impulsive nature mostly affects how I look. One time I was so impulsive in my actions that I went to the hairdresser and cut my long hair to pixie short , although I never regretted that decision of mine but it was a decision for which I took a few minutes. Experimenting with hair colors is another\u00a0act of my impulsive nature , I have had red hair , blond , copper and was about to get blue but thankfully that one time I controlled myself.

If yes , then you know how helpless you feel , how incapable you are in that moment when you could have achieved so much but because some force is pushing you back , you can't. I'm going through such phase right now. My barriers are totally internal , i feel like something is stopping me from crossing that barrier and I feel so hopeless in this situation.These are tough times for me , I'm going through a lot of suffering right now and there are people who are trying to help me a lot.

I just avoid suggestions , I'm not able to do anything and people take this attitude like I don't want to do but they need to understand that I'm not able to do all this.I have realised that my depression has created a sort of barrier inside me , which is caging me up. I'm unable to break that barrier to come out and do stuff which might be actually helpful. I feel like I'm just a step away from breaking that barrier and attain that happiness or that energy which I need right now but being just a step away also I'm not able to get through it.

Initially I couldn't understand this term , I read books on Psychology and googled all I could to understand what exactly it is.\n\nWhat I understood is , my personality flaw is the way is I think or how I react to certain situations , my mind sets , my ideologies. My impulsive behavior is one such flaw , my opinions on certain topics are so different that they doesn't match with society norms , my emotional roller coaster - at times too emotional and at times emotionless, blank. All these are my flaws. My rigid ways of thinking and behaving and thinking have created a lot of emotional distress and that is why these are my flaws.\n\nThese flaws in our personality affects the way we behave and makes it difficult to cope with normal expectations of society which in a long-term makes us feel alienated from others , makes it difficult to live with others and in turn somewhere leads to isolation and stress which may turn to depression. In my case , my thinking , my opinions , the way I want to live , my way of seeing life is very different from people around me , it doesn't look like a problem to me , but it is a flaw which somewhere is a reason for me being depressed.\u00a0\n\nWhen I was told about these flaws and I was asked to mold myself and try to change , it was still rigid about it and I'm still very adamant in changing my ways , I believe that this is how I Am , this is how i have always been , i wont change. This is where therapies come into picture , CBT cognitive behavior therapy and counselling with psychologist was my treatment along side medications. Unfortunately It didn't work out for me.\n\n&gt;A personality disorder is a way of thinking, feeling and behaving that deviates from the expectations of the culture, causes distress or problems functioning, and lasts over time.\n\nOne such disorder is ***Borderline personality disorder (BPD)***\u00a0\u00a0, I was diagnosed with this specific disorder like two weeks ago , I'm still unaware what exactly it is , I just know that it is related to my personality flaws. I'll be starting the treatment for it this week which includes therapy -DBT (DIALECTAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY).\n\n&gt;\\*Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior.

But to become bitter and vindictive in sickness and suffering and to surrender to irrationality, supposing yourself the innocent and virtuous victim\u00a0of the evils intentions of the world, is not inevitable.\n\nGiving up is not an option. I don't know if this is my mood swing speaking or my heart but I feel this today , I can't give up , I can't lose, I won't lose.\u00a0\n\nI had a really terrible last day ( if you read my previous blog , you'll know how negative and hopeless I was) but today I'm better , I'm brighter. I cried a bit , talked a lot , vent out things , thought over stuff a lot and today I feel better. I don't know and\u00a0 even don't want to know how long this will last. I just want to enjoy it till it lasts.\n\nI learnt a few things after having a terrible last day ; Talking is important , talk to your people , your one hour conversation can change your entire mood. Secondly , just keep reminding yourself that this might just be one day , tomorrow again will be a new day. This is how depression feels like , one day you are positive and then don't how many days negative , you have terrible mood swings , your energy level is going up and down and you can't understand what exactly is going on. The key is to let things be. I don't push myself to be happy on bad days or try to be more positive on a happy day , just let the day be like it is , no need to over think.\u00a0\n\n&gt;Remember , If today is a bad day , It wont last long and If it is a good day , even that wont last long. Nothing is permanent.\n\nToday is WORLD MENTAL HEALTH DAY , Since the day I started writing this blog , I just had one aim in mind to make people more aware about mental health. To tell them that IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. Mental illness is just like any physical illness then why to attach so much stigma around it. Why to shy away from speaking about it and why be reluctant to accept it. I have been very open about my illness since day one and I don't do this for attention or any sympathy , it's just that i want to encourage and inspire people to share if they feel the same , to come out and seek help.\n\nI really want everyday to be like today , feeling normal , I miss this feeling!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depressionregimens", "subreddit_id": "t5_37a9h", "subreddit_subscribers": 10766, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "coming out of bad days", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/9myoj9/coming_out_of_bad_days/"}, {"author": "tanvi_0506", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9gier76", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539171639, "domain": "self.depression_help", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9myogv/coming_out_of_bad_days/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9myogv", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression_help/comments/9myogv/coming_out_of_bad_days/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1539171641, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression_help", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zy2x", "subreddit_subscribers": 17946, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "coming out of bad days", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9myogv/coming_out_of_bad_days/"}, {"author": "tanvi_0506", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9gier76", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539105720, "domain": "self.BPD", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/9mr4ns/dbtdialectical_behavior_therapy/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9mr4ns", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/BPD/comments/9mr4ns/dbtdialectical_behavior_therapy/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539105721, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm beginning my DBT this week .

Black hole is sucking up all my positivity\u00a0 , energy and I'm left sad , blank , hopeless and empty. And this one might be the most negative blog I have written till now , but sharing this is also important , this is the real dark side of depression.\n\nI feel like giving up now , I'm tired of this feeling now , I'm tired of being depressed , fighting my anxious mind , I can't bear all this any more. I don't want to die , I just want to get back to normal . Suicidal thoughts come to my mind but right now I'm handling them , but now I'm tired of my medicines , I'm tired of pretending to be hopeful and positive all the time , but it's sucking up all my energy now . It feels like either I don't want to live or I want to get back to the old me. I miss the old me ,\u00a0 I have forgotten how I was before these things happened to me , I don't remember how my days went by , how I used to talk , laugh and behave like a normal person . I have forgotten all of this. I have lost the hope that some day I'll be normal , sleeping without pills , not seeing doctors every 20 days , not thinking about depression.\n\nRight now , my doctor has already given up on me , he has referred me to Delhi or Bangalore because our city doesn't have specialists. May be I'm just over thinking but this is what I think. I don't know its my anxiety which makes me feel this but I really feel my closest people have also given up on me. Right now , I'm in so much need of support but I don't have my people with me , there were people who stood around me for a long but lately they have disappeared , I'm not angry at them I'm just disappointed . I get to hear phrases like \" I'm fed up with you &amp; your problems \" , I know why do they say this , people expect me to get better , they suggest me things but what they don't realize is I don't have that energy , motivation to get up and do things, getting up daily and going to work is enough I can do these days. I know you people want me to get better but your behavior is not exactly helping me. I know everyone is going through a lot in their lives but you are closest people I have and at times I need you.\n\nI know giving up is an act of coward.

It's two opposing feelings fighting with each other and fucking up your brain.*\n\n***Never have I dealt with anything more difficult\u00a0than this.***\n\n\ud83d\udcf7", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "subreddit_subscribers": 123170, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "living with anxiety", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/9me8p2/living_with_anxiety/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "tanvi_0506", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9gier76", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538998482, "domain": "self.depression_help", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9me2m2/living_with_anxiety/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9me2m2", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression_help/comments/9me2m2/living_with_anxiety/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1538998483, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression_help", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zy2x", "subreddit_subscribers": 17863, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Living with Anxiety", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9me2m2/living_with_anxiety/"}, {"author": "tanvi_0506", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9gier76", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538816366, "domain": "self.socialanxiety", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/9lukje/depression_is_not_just_another_word_for_sadness/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9lukje", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/socialanxiety/comments/9lukje/depression_is_not_just_another_word_for_sadness/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538816367, "score": 1, "selftext": "What I'm sharing today is what I want people to know and realise and get in into their heads!Mental health is the most misunderstood topic and people have so many myths associated with it but being a sufferer , I want to share this on behalf of every one struggling out there that Depression is not what you think.Depression is not just crying alone at 3 am in night , it is not just being a chain smoker or a binge drinker writing sad poetries , it is not just being alone and being sad for a while and then again being happy , it's not like just locking yourself up and being isolated , it is much more than these. Depressed person is not someone who would be sitting alone in a corner in the room or someone who won't step out of their homes or they are not someone who behaves oddly so that everyone around them know that there is something wrong with them.No, depression is not like this . I'm depressed but I go out , I hang around with people, I party hard and I do everything that a normal person does . I do everything, I go to work , I talk with my friends, I meet them , I attend family gatherings, I attend people. But while doing all this , I'm zoned out at times , I'm not completely present anywhere. It might happen that I'm smiling on your face but deep inside i know I'm not happy , there is always something eating me up.But there are days when I'm actually not getting up , I won't shower for days keep lying there with my greasy hair and dirty body , I won't step out of my room , I'll lock myself, I'll starve my self and I would harm myself just for the pleasure of pain. I won't clean up my surroundings despite knowing how dirty everything is but I'm left there with no energy or motivation to do this. There are times , when I don't go out , don't meet anyone , don't talk to anyone but it is not always like that. On days , I post happy pictures on social media feeling happy about everything but there are days when it's filled with sad pictures. Don't judge us by what we post!!It really feels like a slow moving traffic in my head , I'll process things slowly or won't even listen to any if it. What exactly I feel is clogged up thoughts in my brain , trying to make their way out or sometimes it feels like there is so much to think about that It makes me anxious and then the horror of pain attack strikes. There are times when there is only space for negative thoughts in my mind , only dark exists , I'll think about every negative thing which i can think of and cry over it. It's about imaging things which actually doesn't exist and your mind keeps trying to solve every part of it. Your mind is completely fucked up , you never know what emotion may come out of it and how would you react.Every time people pops out strange questions at me.\"What is there in your life to be depressed about \"\"You have much more than we have and still your unhappy , impossible! \"\"Are you seriously depressed?\"\"Doctor , does she really have this illness\"\"Go out , engage yourself \"\"It's just in your head , you are making most if it\"\"We have more problems in our life but still we are happy , why are you depressed \"\"You don't look depressed\"\"Ahh , you don't need medicines , do yoga\"\"Don't feel like this , it's just because you are feeling it too much\"GUYS YOU NEED TO STOP!!!Yes , I don't have anything to be depressed about - For your information There is a term for it - \"Endogenous depression\".Yes , I have every materialistic happiness , my every wish is always granted, i have the best of everything but depression is not about lacking materialistic things , it's deeper than that.Yes , I'm seriously depressed, spend a day with me and you'll realise this.Depression is not about how you look , i can be very well dressed and yet can be depressed, please get this in your head!!Yes , you have more problems in your life and I appreciate you to handle them so well , but absence of any problems doesn't make me feel good all the time , it's my mind!!It's not JUST a feeling , it is the worst feeling.Its not something I made up in my head , I feel that , i feel in every corner of my heart!!If engaging in new things was so easy for us , we would have done it already!!Please stop asking such questions to us , we can't explain you this every time. We are already dealing with a lot in our life please don't make it worse by asking such questions or just snapping it.Please understand this and be little thoughtful about us. We don't need your attention but we don't want you to underestimate our problems.

It all started in July 2017 and now it's October 2018 , I have had almost 10 different kind of anti depressants , SSRI's , SNRI's , anti - psychotic drugs , anti - epilepsy drugs , anti- anxiety drugs , sleeping pills .\u00a0\n\n&gt;Scientifically speaking , Low\u00a0**serotonin**\u00a0levels have been linked to\u00a0**depression**.\u00a0**Serotonin**\u00a0is an important chemical and neurotransmitter in the human body.

Serotonin is one of the chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that carry signals between\u00a0**brain**\u00a0cells.

My sleeping pattern was completely disturbed , I was on sleeping pills and in those 4 months I was on at least 4 pills a day , my morning started with a pill and ended with one.\n\nWhen you have been on drugs for this long , your brain gets used to them and when you miss them for a day also , they cause terrible effects. In my case , if I miss my pill for even a single day , I can't function normally , I experience ***BRAIN ZAPS***or ***BRAIN SHOCKS***\u00a0.

This changed my entire course of treatment , I started feeling better and within days I started feeling normal actually felt happy . My energy level was better , I was engaged in things , I slept better , I ate properly , I started talking to people.

Anti- depressants block the re-absorption (re uptake) of serotonin in the\u00a0**brain**, making more serotonin available.\n\n\u00a0When I began with the treatment , I started with one anti depressant\u00a0drug.

My sleeping pattern was completely disturbed , I was on sleeping pills and in those 4 months I was on at least 4 pills a day , my morning started with a pill and ended with one.\n\nWhen you have been on drugs for this long , your brain gets used to them and when you miss them for a day also , they cause terrible effects. In my case , if I miss my pill for even a single day , I can't function normally , I experience ***BRAIN ZAPS***or ***BRAIN SHOCKS***\u00a0.

It took me weeks to prepare myself to go out and seek help , talking to a complete stranger about my problems , feelings and illness especially if you have never let anyone enter into your zone before. But this is important and I realized it before it was too late and thus my journey toward the change began.\n\nWhen I decided to come out and meet a professional , the most difficult part was finding a doctor with whom you actually feel comfortable. Since I have started my treatment I have been to 5 psychiatrists &amp; Psychologists until I found the perfect one.\n\nFrom my experience I realized few things one should keep in mind before meeting a psychiatrist. We need to be open about sharing our problems without any fear of being judged , doctors never judge you. Never hide any of your feelings or emotions from doctors , you never know what can help them to treat you better. Always have faith in your doctor , they are professionals and they are there to help you.\n\nWhen I started looking for help , I met doctors who took just 15 minutes to diagnose me with *Obsessive Compulsive Disorder* , some said its **just**\u00a0*anxiety* ,\u00a0 some said yo*u should have come to us earlier*. Some of the doctors declined treating me without my parents.In my initial days I met doctors they prescribed me handful of anti-depressant and that's it they had no interest in my past , my present nothing . They just gave me pills and I took them , felt worse than ever **but never lost hope.**\u00a0\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_media-596\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1880\"\\]\ud83d\udcf7 Photo by Lynnelle Richardson on [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/photo/art-artistic-black-and-white-blank-311391/)\\[/caption\\]\n\nBut then I gave up because I thought if this is how the treatment works , I don't want to continue and then one day when I\u00a0had a real downfall I met a doctor , who is still treating me and he is the best I have met so far . We had a 1 hour face to face session in which I shared every aspect of my life with him . Yes, this is difficult to do but it is the most important thing.Remember , change doesn't happen overnight , it take months to change without us feeling but its people around who see and understand these changes.\n\nAfter our session , he was really supportive , calm and he just told me that \" Tanvi ,\u00a0 it's just a chemical imbalance in your brain.\" I was really relaxed after that , he also gave me pills but they were far better than what I took before and so my treatment began.\n\nIts has been more than a year , I have had variety of anti depressant , some made me feel good some made me worse but it's just ups and downs , your doctor is always there for you. There were times when I was asked to get hospitalized , I had seen worst days while undergoing treatment , medicines , CT Scans , MRI and what not just to find the actual problem.\n\nAlways remember ,the most important thing while taking a psychiatric treatment is patience. You need to give yourself and your doctor some time. Any disorder cannot be diagnosed in few minutes , it take months to diagnose your actual problems and while this time all your doctor wants from you is your patience. It took my doctor almost a month to diagnose me with ***Endogenous Depression***\u00a0*&amp; almost a year to*\u00a0***diagnose Borderline personality\u00a0disorder.***\n\n&gt;*Some people become depressed after losing a loved one, ending a relationship, or experiencing a trauma. However,* ***endogenous depression*** *occurs without an obvious stressful event or other trigger. Symptoms often appear suddenly and for no apparent reason.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Borderline personality disorde****r is a mental illness marked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior. These symptoms often result in impulsive actions and problems in relationships.

Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life.\n\n&gt;A person may say they are feeling \u2018depressed,\u2019 but if it goes away on its own and doesn\u2019t impact life in a big way, it probably isn\u2019t the illness of depression.\n\nDepression is a mental illness that affects your mood,\u00a0 It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It\u2019s much more than sadness or low mood.\n\nIf I share my personal experience it was horrifying. I have spent most of the years unknowingly suffering from depression. It all started with basic feeling of \" feeling blue\" , \" feeling low\" . I started losing my interest , I used to spend days in my room alone sobbing and feeling frustrated , avoiding family , avoiding calls , whatsapp , friends . I didn't eat for days and even if I ate it was late at nights when I knew i wouldn't have to face people. I felt empty inside , I had no energy within to talk , to think , to speak &amp; the worst is I started feeling suicidal , I started self harming , I still have those marks on my body which reminds me daily of my struggles. It was like a black hole which was sucking all my energy and was pulling me in a darker world. You know the bad part is it was not only I who suffered , my family , my closest friends they suffered too. It's been a year and I still haven't recovered , I have these same feelings, I'm still suicidal and I still\u00a0 harm myself. But I have not lost my hope , I know one day I'll be a normal 24-year-old happy girl.\n\n&gt;***Remember , Suicide or self harm doesn't end your pain , it just passes on to others.***", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression_help", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zy2x", "subreddit_subscribers": 17723, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Understanding depression", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9l9qcg/understanding_depression/"}, {"author": "tanvi_0506", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9gier76", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538637538, "domain": "self.tanvi_0506", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tanvi_0506/comments/9l9p11/understanding_depression/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9l9p11", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/u_tanvi_0506/comments/9l9p11/understanding_depression/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1538637538, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nIt takes up a lot of courage to make a decision to seek professional help because we are grown up in a society where mental health is never given a priority.

You are left with no energy and you literally feel dead.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_media-35\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1880\"\\]\ud83d\udcf7 Photo by Maria Tyutina on [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-facing-back-photo-745869/)\\[/caption\\]\n\n**It's important to understand the difference between sadness and depression** . Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life.\n\n&gt;A person may say they are feeling \u2018depressed,\u2019 but if it goes away on its own and doesn\u2019t impact life in a big way, it probably isn\u2019t the illness of depression.\n\nDepression is a mental illness that affects your mood,\u00a0 It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It\u2019s much more than sadness or low mood.\n\nIf I share my personal experience it was horrifying. I have spent most of the years unknowingly suffering from depression. It all started with basic feeling of \" feeling blue\" , \" feeling low\" . I started losing my interest , I used to spend days in my room alone sobbing and feeling frustrated , avoiding family , avoiding calls , whatsapp , friends . I didn't eat for days and even if I ate it was late at nights when I knew i wouldn't have to face people. I felt empty inside , I had no energy within to talk , to think , to speak &amp; the worst is I started feeling suicidal , I started self harming , I still have those marks on my body which reminds me daily of my struggles. It was like a black hole which was sucking all my energy and was pulling me in a darker world. You know the bad part is it was not only I who suffered , my family , my closest friends they suffered too. It's been a year and I still haven't recovered , I have these same feelings, I'm still suicidal and I still\u00a0 harm myself. But I have not lost my hope , I know one day I'll be a normal 24-year-old happy girl.\n\n&gt;***Remember , Suicide or self harm doesn't end your pain , it just passes on to others.***", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "u_tanvi_0506", "subreddit_id": "t5_pevvt", "subreddit_subscribers": 0, "subreddit_type": "user", "suggested_sort": "qa", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UNDERSTANDING DEPRESSION", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tanvi_0506/comments/9l9p11/understanding_depression/"}, {"author": "tanvi_0506", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9gier76", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538637500, "domain": "self.tanvi_0506", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tanvi_0506/comments/9l9oww/a_girl_with_illness/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9l9oww", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/u_tanvi_0506/comments/9l9oww/a_girl_with_illness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1538637501, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nI planned writing a blog a long time back but couldn't gather enough courage to share my story.
