is something i\u2019ve never told anyone and i really, really need to just say it. \ni lied about being sexually abused.\nwhat i did was absolutely wrong and terrible and disgusting but i want to clarify something. this may be terrible wording but no one was gravely affected by my lie. this isn\u2019t me trying to be like \u201coh what i did wasn\u2019t bad because no one was hurt!\u201d it is just i read a lot about women going to the cops and accusing someone of rape with the intent of them being arrested. that was not my goal. the only person i told this lie to was my ex-girlfriend. i was 13 when it happened and growing up i was a pretty bad chronic liar. i typically told lies that made me seem like a more interesting person. even when my parents asked me about my day at school, i made up some story or told another person\u2019s story except with me being the main character. when i was younger i always thought i was absolutely boring and just worthless so by lying, i could make people like me more. i thought i could get attention. in middle school, i met my girlfriend, but it was online. as friends, it was great. we had a wonderful friendship. after we met in real life twice, i realized i developed feelings for a girl, and it was crazy and terrifying to me. i eventually mustered up the courage to ask her out, to which she said yes, and we began a relationship. it went to shit real quick. i didn\u2019t really have friends in real life, so i spent most of my days talking to her, whether at school or home. she took this to advantage when i wanted to go out. she would call me screaming at me and saying i didn\u2019t love her or that i was just like everyone else. i didn\u2019t want to lose the only person that was currently in my life, so i would stay home and talk to her. i would stay silent when she went out with exes then telling me how they almost got in trouble together or how her ex-boyfriend tried kissing her. it drove me crazy, and i had recently lost my grandfather who i was extremely close with, and my parents never really gave me support through it. i had no one except her, and i was so lonely. i started self-harming and eventually caught on to the fact that if i told my girlfriend i was about to hurt myself, she would pay attention to me. if i told her i was suicidal, she wouldn\u2019t go out with friends and she would talk to me. if i refused to eat because i thought starving myself to death would be the best option for me, she\u2019d listen to me. i didn\u2019t lie about doing that or feeling like that. i was a huge self-harmer for about four years. i\u2019ve been clean for about a year. i was extremely suicidal after my grandfather\u2019s passing, attempting two times, and i did develop anorexia. but i was never sexually assaulted. i didn\u2019t give her a name, i just told her it happened to me when i was 10. i just wanted her to listen to me and not leave me. it sounds so, so fucking terrible to say. i just turned 17 monday, and i still haven\u2019t told anyone what i lied about. i almost told a therapist but as soon as i got comfortable with them i wasn\u2019t able to see them anymore because we lost health insurance. \ni have no more contact with the ex-girlfriend, and i haven\u2019t since i was 15. i got so depressed and didn\u2019t let anyone help lift me up because i was so engrossed in her. she started cheating on me because i needed to fix myself and she claimed that she could not deal with it. i admitted myself to a mental hospital because i had a mental breakdown but didn\u2019t want to hurt my family by severely hurting myself. when i got out, she told me it was still over and to leave her the fuck alone, so i completely lost it. i am more mentally stable now, being diagnosed with bpd and given proper medication, and i try not to lie, but i am still so sick with myself. there is no way to justify what i lied about when people truly suffer from sexual abuse. i can never make up for what i did, and i feel like such a god awful person.
