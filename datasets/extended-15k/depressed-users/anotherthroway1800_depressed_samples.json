And you said we would work through it. You\u2019d be my support. And then you flaked on me again. And again. And again. \n\nSo I called you out on it. And you blocked me. And we talked in person and you unblocked me. Then a few days went by and you exposed all the lies you told me. Was it a week long fight? I don\u2019t remember. Then you blocked me. \n\nAnd I went around it. Time and time again. It would make /r niceguys look tame. But you triggered my mania and psychosis. Good job. \n\nMy childish tantrum worked and we started hanging out again. But you said it was out of fear. Then said you wanted to help. Then you once again used me and flaked on me. \n\nI don\u2019t remember that weeks worth of messages. I was so drunk. And you called the cops on me.

You wasted the last 2 years of his life and time. I truly hope that you weren\u2019t lying when you said you didn\u2019t have any friends. Because truthfully I\u2019ve found out I do have some.

But if I didn\u2019t edit it too much personal info would be exposed. \n\nPlease read this, there\u2019s nothing mean or evil in it. One last favor. Just a rambling apology. But I know I\u2019ve completely lost it. Like you saw. I am sorry. I am so sorry. I\u2019m broken and I can\u2019t be fixed and I fuck up everything every time. \n\nWhat\u2019s sad. I actually used to be a good person. I had a few close friends. I was nice, caring, funny. I was actually smart. I was interesting and had a future. People liked me. I was good at what I wanted to be at. I really don\u2019t know what happened. Well actually... I had a mental breakdown and psychosis and undiagnosed bipolar. I used to be good haley. I wish you knew me then. \n\nWe can never talk again. I fucked up last year. I fucked up back in April. And all summer. And then in September. I know that. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to repair it there. It still sucks. It still hurt. But I understand. We could never be friends haley. I did that. And I failed. I failed so bad. I\u2019m a failure and I fucked everything up. I have more marks on my arm now. I burn myself every time I fuck up. And I fuck up a lot. \n\nI wish I was half as lucky as Daniel. To have a girl like you it my life. To be something real with you. Instead of just a customer. \n\nWhat I told you the first night back in August was true. No matter what. I wouldn\u2019t expose you like that. To your family. It was just Childish threats to get you to respond. The blackmail threats were never true. I would never have done that to you. \n\nI don\u2019t even remember what we actually ended up fighting about on Wednesday. I was so wasted while mixing my meds with flu meds with the alcohol. And I wanted to hurt you so I could just do it. Just kill myself. None of it was true. I was being a massive dick. And it worked. And I regret that too. I regret everything. \n\nI\u2019m just not in my clear state of mind anymore. I haven\u2019t been for months. Ever since April. And I get so good at hiding it because what I am about to do scares me. So much. Psychwards terrify me...\n\nAnd not even my doctor can help me anymore. I\u2019ve come to the point in my treatment. After 2.5 years of treatment for depression and then 9 months treatment for bipolar apparently there is only so much a med can do for me?\n\nMy doctor keeps pushing one pill on me despite it not working for the last 3 months. As my life continues to go down the drain. Yet she keeps doing it because I\u2019ve had no negative reaction yet unlike I had to a few other pills. But I\u2019m getting nothing out of it. Now she is saying that I just need to change my life. But how can I do that when I\u2019m so depressed I sleep all day and barely hold down a min wage job. I can\u2019t do anything social because I have no energy, and I fuck it all up anyway. I don\u2019t even do anything fun anymore.\n\nI\u2019m sorry it came to what it did. I meant none of it. I wanted you to hate me. And it worked. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve made your life a living hell the last 6 months. I\u2019m sorry for everything. \n\nI wanted to be your friend. More than anything. I tried. I wanted to be your friend more than anything else in this world. From November to February I let you take it slow. Because I wanted you to trust me again.\n\nI wish we had gotten that pizza Haley. I wish we would have met not at your job. It would have removed so many issues from it all. For me and for you. But this life just sucks. Every time I hung out with you i felt like I had known you for years. I was comfortable with you. The first person ever that I had felt that way about. \n\nBut you really are amazing. You\u2019re kind, caring, and always were able to make me feel comfortable. You truly are amazing. I never connected with someone like I did with you. To be able to talk to you about anything. I would have been lucky to be your friend. That\u2019s why it hurt. That\u2019s why this all hurt. And I was lucky that you spent as much time with me as you did. Every single minute you wasted on me made me feel important. I wish everything in my fucked up life could have been so different. I do hope you find happiness in getting a masters and get that job that makes you happy. You do deserve it. You deserve so much better from this shitty world. You don\u2019t deserve to be unhappy. You are too good for that. If there was a god in this fucked up world... you are an angel. You deserve so much better from this world. \n\nI was going to off myself like I said the first week at psu. I even had signed up for a class to use it as further cover. The whole planning it thing was true. I just failed at doing it. I fail at everything. I couldn\u2019t do it to my mom, the only person that does care about me anymore. \n\nI am so fucking lost right now and I have been for months. And I\u2019ve been so alone. I\u2019m always alone. And all I needed was someone to believe in me. A friend would have been enough. All my friends abandoned me when I became depressed. And I don\u2019t have a significant other to lean on. I\u2019m so alone. Being able to text you randomly was one of the best things I\u2019ve had in the last 8 years. You had no idea how good it made me feel to feel like someone actually cared. \n\nI\u2019m broken. So fucking broken. You actually gave me hope. For the time that I met you. You gave me something to look forward to again. And now that\u2019s gone. My life\u2019s been a fucked up mess ever since college ended. I really do think I killed my self that night the gun jammed when I had it in my mouth. And I\u2019m in hell. \n\nIf you read this all. Thank you. And I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI\u2019m not made for this world. I\u2019m too broken and fucked up to ever find any place in this world. \n\nEver since I met you, you really were my reason to try and be better. So I could hang out with you. You always were the highlight of my week Haley. I truly did want to be your friend. And it ruined me that you never gave me the chance. I give up on this life.  \n\nI really did want to be your friend. That\u2019s why all of this hurt so much. I\u2019ve cried every day since April. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\n\nYou know I wake up crying now. Because you haunt my dreams. I want to go back to April. So badly. I just want this pain to end. I\u2019m fucked up. I know I am. I know I am. I\u2019m sorry Haley that I fucked this all up\n\nI want to be well again. I want to be the person I was years ago. I wish you met me then. I was a good person then. I had dreams. I had hopes. I was a good person then. Not this lifeless corpse I\u2019ve become. I\u2019m a terrible person. I know that. I truly do.
