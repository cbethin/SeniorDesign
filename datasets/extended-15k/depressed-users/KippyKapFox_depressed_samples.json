He was definitely abusive to my mom, it's why they divorced. But I don't know if he was really, truly abusive to me, or if we just had difficulties communicating because of his narc tendencies. \n\nI see so many people on this Reddit go through hell, and I feel disgusted for calling my situation \"abuse\" when truthfully it was not that bad.\n\nA short list of some (general) things he did (linking to save space): \nhttps://sta.sh/0tnmccy22zw \n\nI actually have a pretty good relationship with my Dad now. A lot of \"abusive tendencies\" are in the past. As I got older I've learned to avoid ticking him off so we are on good terms. He is actually nice most of the time. I'm not scared to go to his house. He supports and compliments my art and grades, saying he is proud of me. He compliments my appearance and personality, and shows gratitude for certain things. He shows concern for my emotions, but when he himself inflicts the pain, he doesn't seem to care at all, no matter how upset I am, he only cares about how I've \"wronged\" him. We share interests. He takes me out to eat, gives me gifts, spends time with me, and tells me he loves me. I believe him.\n\nBut when he lashes out all over again, I sometimes doubt if he really loves me. I have a loving mother and stepfather and I know they'd never act like my dad, even if they were mad at me. Sometimes his love and emotions feels shallow to me sometimes. I don't want to admit this though because I don't want to make my situation seem worse than it actually is, and I believe he does love me. \n\nSometimes I'm scared my mom was just victimizing me. I didn't grow up feeling traumatized from Dad's actions. She told me that Dad was narcissistic and verbally abusive from a young age, so I grew up being bitter against my dad, hating him, and calling every little thing I didn't like him doing abusive. But what if that led me to believe I was being abused when I really wasn't? \n\nShe used to write journal entries about \"inicidents.\" Apparently after a school concert every kid was given a candy cane, and my Dad made me throw it on the ground because he didn't want food on the floor. My mother considered this \"emotional and unempathetic abuse\" for \"not letting me enjoy the Xmas holiday.\" I call it pathetic and trivial. So maybe she is exaggerating things? \n\nI do love my dad, he's still family and I forgive him. I think he loves me, but has a different way of showing it, and sometimes that love can be compromised if I trigger the \"narc bomb.\" I don't plan on going NC with him. I'm actually very grateful he's rather tame as far as narcs (or verbal abusers) go. But if it was really abuse, wouldn't I be traumatized and bitter at my dad? \n\nI've talked to my mom about this. She says my dad was verbally abusive to me, but I wasn't abused. What? Was he abusive or was he not? Make up your mind? \n\nAm I really verbally abused? Or do I just have a difficult parent? Is mild abuse a thing? Is it possible to have a good feelings toward them? I'm confused. I feel like I've just been playing the victim my whole life. Am I just a spoiled, whiny brat? \nPlease tell me the truth instead of blindly validating me. Thanks for helping.

It doesn't run in my family. Basically, I came out as gay to a best friend/crush, who eventually stopped talking to me, and I felt she was rejecting me because I was gay. Then, I started sitting alone at lunch tables because I felt too awkward to be around her, which cut me off from the rest of my friends. Then it was a downward spiral of crying, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, low self-esteem, and \"nobody likes me.\" I used to be pretty attention-seeking to my internet friends on social media whenever I was feeling bad and needed help, but I ended up being melodramatic. I did see a doctor eventually who said I match the symptoms and I got medicated, but looking back at my life I feel like I'm just a dramatic teen who was manipulating people. A faker. I had some overeating / slight sleeping issues / slight isolation, but it wasn't THAT bad. I still went to school everyday. I got out of bed, socialized outside of school, and did hobbies, even if I didn't feel like it. My therapist said I displayed lethargy, although lethargy wasn't the highlight of being depressed for me, my tearful sadness was. I'm a little older now and mostly recovered. Everything is better except for the fact that I just feel emotionally empty and hate myself. And I feel like I did it to myself because I couldn't handle something like a simple breakup when I was 12, so I feel like any residual depression is my fault. \n\nWas I misdiagnosed and just being a teenager? I brought this up to my therapist. He insists I wasn't faking. But I don't feel I can believe him.
