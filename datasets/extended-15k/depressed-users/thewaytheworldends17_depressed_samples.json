The house is so tense and horrible some days. I spend most of my time in my room. My dad's morbidly obese and can't work, but won't acknowledge it - he refuses to help himself in any way or go on some form of pension or disability payment to help my mum pay the rent, which she can't cover on top of bills and grocery shopping with her own wage. I loan Mum money which I get from my student payments, which she puts towards smokes and booze to 'cope'. She's not a total alcoholic yet, but it won't be much longer if my dad can't find some way of helping her out. Both of them are depressed too and like to occasionally toss out threats of suicide. Both say they won't follow through, but neither takes particularly good care of themselves. Mum's a type-1 diabetic on top of everything else. They're absolute tools, but I love them both. If one of them actually were to die, and I'm so scared that might happen soon, I'd be homeless. There's no other option.\n\nOn Oct 30th, it'll be eight years to the day since I last worked. I was diagnosed with shitty kidneys and high blood pressure when I was twenty, and starting taking meds to lower it. I wasn't able to stand at my checkout for longer than a couple of hours without passing out or falling over, so I had to leave. I've tweaked my resume more times than I can count since then, done so many short and long courses to get job-ready. I've applied for at least a thousand jobs this year (it feels like, at least). had a few interviews this year, mostly for seasonal jobs over Christmas, but they've all gone nowhere. I don't know how to make my skills stand out in a world where I'm fighting 500 other vastly more qualified people for the same job. I hate it. The rejections are starting to add up and weigh on me. I feel so completely worthless. \n\nSometimes I regret getting a dumbass degree in Creative Writing, then banging a year of honours on top just because I enjoyed it. Just because I needed something to get me out of the house. I didn't have the high school grades for much else (I would have loved to have studied something like biomedical science, but I've never had a head for maths or chemistry). But my story-writing is apparently pretty good. I hardly ever got less than an A for anything I submitted.\n\nI'm also still a virgin, never been kissed, never so much as been glanced at by a guy. I'm in two minds over this. Relieved, because even if it did happen, I'd be too terrified to let it go anywhere. The idea of falling in love with someone is nice until it gives me a panic attack. I can't take the idea that I might someday hate someone the same way my mum hates my dad. And also heartbroken, because there must be something horribly wrong with me, right?\n\nI don't have anyone to talk to about this kind of stuff. My brother moved out years ago, and he's got his own crap to deal with. Ever since I was little, I've never been good at making friends. I was always the kid sitting in the corner with a book, and I never really grew out of it.\n\nI'd give anything to just disappear. But I know I can't. I'd leave behind the worst mess. Most of the time, it's my pet dogs and my bird which keep me here. I really don't know what else to do or say. I feel so incredibly trapped and stuck where I am, and I'm absolutely terrified it'll never get better.\n\nProps if you made it this far.
