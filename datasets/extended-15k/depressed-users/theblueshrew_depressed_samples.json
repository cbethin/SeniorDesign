It's not my first language.   \nHey guys. I'm male, autistic, mute (a defect caused meant that my vocal cords couldn't form properly) and to be 18 in December. I remember my childhood because it was great: cartoons were great, video games (stuff like Mario, Sonic and Donkey Kong Country) were awesome to play, my parents were loving, the internet was awesome (especially YouTube), there was massive amount of snow in the winter, Christmas was awesome, and I grew up in a special educational institution in my early years. I remember going to the cinema with my dad every other week, going out into the city, etc. \n\nBut that's all in the past, and that fact really frustrates me. \n\nI was beginning to feel severe despondent and dejected, inadequate and guilty. I started sleeping much more and refused to eat. So many things set me off, whether it be someone saying something about me behind my back or having delusions of seeing myself dying early and foreseeing my death. I had suicidal tendencies frequently. I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 13, when I was going into an actual mainstream high school. The next year, I had my first seizure (on a Friday the 13th, funnily enough). I thought it was a one-off until they kept occurring, and that was when I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I have to take tablets for both my depression and epilepsy. It controls my epilepsy, but it's hard dealing with the former. \n\nBut by far one of the most horrible feelings of all was nostalgia. It creeped up on me all the time and it still does. I have no idea how it's supposed to be a good feeling at all.   \nThe other day I was listening to some music from video games that I used to love playing (like the ones already mentioned). I was listening to music from New Super Mario Bros. (DS) and it actually made me cry a little bit. It honestly made me feel so upset knowing how much more fun it was to actually play it at the time as a child. It doesn't feel the same playing it now or watching things I used to love now. I really wish I could just be in front of that bulky television playing on my N64 as well, or watching Pixar films over and over again (still love them by the way, just love the feeling of reliving my time as a young kid). I really want to be in the moment that I remember from the past. \n\nYouTube was so much better in the past. I remember as a kid watching full episodes of South Park, Family Guy, Beavis &amp; Butt-Head and Simpsons on there, watching those weird videos of obviously photoshopped pictures I thought were real, compilations of obviously fake movie trailers and \"future gen consoles\", and those GTA myth videos. I hate seeing all this PewDiePie and KSI and Paul Brothers shit nowadays.\n\nThings like Christmas and Halloween feel really dull. I remember when it would used to snow on even Halloween and when it was during the holidays. It doesn't even snow on Christmas or my birthday as much. I go to the local park sometimes and cross the bridge where it would used to be covered with snow and ice would cover the lake... just plain now. I really wonder why I even do it. \n\nEverything seems to catch up on me. The slightest things can trigger me and get me thinking back to a much better time in my life. \n\nMy life isn't terrible right now, just hard. A lot of responsibilities to make, have to catch up on everything. I'm planning on moving out soon. I'm fully aware of the fact that that's not as easy as it sounds and I will certainly try and get some help in learning how exactly to do that before actually going in. But I definitely just want some time to myself. If I have a bit more freedom, get a paying job and live on my own then maybe I'll enjoy living in the past a bit more. I'm not saying that I'd still go to bed in my pajamas and still call my father \"daddy\" or \"dada\" or anything, but I'd at least like to keep a few things with me from the past to give me a bit of comfort when I actually **feel like it.** Right now isn't the most appropriate time yet it keeps creeping up on me.\n\nI also keep having feelings of inadequacy. I really like drawing, writing and making music. I think these interests are particularly important to me because it makes up for my limited form of communication otherwise (can't talk); they're a good way of expressing myself. I'm not sure if this would make much sense, but it really annoys me when something is \"too good\". So there's something that's so good hat it makes you feel so inadequate. Like if you see a really good drawing, or read a really good book, or listen to a song or instrumental so good. And you feel like giving up on what you do because you just feel that you can never get to a level you hope to achieve. Don't worry, I'm not giving up entirely on these but certain things just discourage me from time to time. It makes me realise how much things are easier said than done. \n\nI keep looking back at the past, wanting to relive it but I know that's impossible. From time to time it has made me think of suicide, but I don't know if I'd actually want to die or not.

They\u2019re both black cats, and are similar in appearance but the male is bigger and has blue eyes, while the female has green eyes. I called the male (Super) Mario and the female Jiji.\n\nJiji\u2019s more of an indoor kind, but Mario is very adventurous. My garden is quite large (like many of the other surrounding gardens), but Mario loves exploring (although he doesn\u2019t like going into the front yard very much). Mario had a habit of straying quite far from my garden into other people\u2019s gardens, and this was a habit of his I didn\u2019t particularly like, primarily because of the presence of larger dogs, and\u2026 well, he could get lost. There was one garden he quite liked visiting in particular, where food was often left out for the cats and dogs of the owner, but untouched. Mario took advantage of this and often ate bits of it from out of the bowl at one moment and then return again at about 15 or 30 minutes later so that he didn\u2019t get spotted too easily. He also had habits of stealing and bringing back shiny items.\n\nOne day he ended up in my next door neighbour\u2019s garden (not intentionally), and he came across a flat-coated Pomeranian called Rosa. The most that I knew about Rosa initially was that she was quite friendly, but she was the only pet of her owner, who also didn\u2019t have a partner.\n\nAnyway, I initially thought that Rosa would have reacted somewhat aggressively to Mario\u2019s presence, but I was surprised to find that she actually ran up to him to\u2026 try and cuddle with and lick him. She made no attempt at all to bite him or intentionally harm him in any other way. Mario was very confused, but didn\u2019t want any of it. Rosa tried to chase him again, but Mario proved too quick and simply ran back into his own garden. I know dominating when I see it and Rosa definitely wasn\u2019t trying to dominate Mario\u2026 at least not intentionally or aggressively. Rosa\u2019s owner didn\u2019t seem to notice anything, and I think he might have been asleep at the time, although it should be worth noting that Rosa\u2019s owner doesn\u2019t often look out for her when she\u2019s outside.\n\nAbout a day after that, Rosa\u2019s owner went on holiday and took her with him. When they came back after about a week, I noticed that Rosa seemed pretty eager to go back into her garden. Mario was outside in my garden at the time, and Rosa came literally sprinting to see him. Rosa didn\u2019t look comfortable about the idea of passing the hedge for some reason, but she knew for a fact that Mario was on the other side. My neighbour seemed a bit confused as to what was happening and why Rosa was behaving in such a way, but he took her back in anyway.\n\nI thought this would just be a one-off and that she would just forget about him, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case as Rosa seemed to be obsessed with both Mario and trying to find a way into my yard. There were many other cats around that came into both my garden and hers, but she didn't seem to care too much. Hell, I don't even think she cares too much about other dogs.  \nMario hates her. He's quite solitary in nature, and he wasn\u2019t exactly the best of friends with dogs. He either tried to fight Rosa or fled from her when cornered. Mario wasn\u2019t really interested in female cats either.\n\nMario sometimes did come into the garden, but mostly either by accident or because of food being left out (Rosa wasn\u2019t fed kibble, but rather actual meat). Rosa became especially excited when food was served outside because it\u2019d mean Mario could be around. Rosa used this to her advantage, and either hid herself while watching him, or tried to catch him.   \nOn one occasion, I went outside just in time to see her waiting quite patiently under a tree where Mario was taking a nap. Mario woke up as soon as I walked outside, and found the dog sitting under. Once Mario got down, he quickly sprinted and jumped around to avoid her, hitting her a few times as she got close, but she was still persistent and continued the chase. She simply couldn\u2019t catch him that time.\n\nMy neighbour started trimming the hedge to the point where there was more visibility into my garden from the other side, and Rosa used this to start spying on Mario more often.\n\nMario has started to spend more time around Jiji and my dog Max. Max, however, is still very keen to go out.\n\nI think the real question is why does she act this way towards Mario? Maybe she's just a bit lonely? Maybe she likes his soft fur? \n\nI've read before that Pomeranians are apparently good around cats, but this is just a bit different.\n\nMario still goes outside, just not for as long a period of time. I suspect that Rosa still uses this time to spy on him anyway.\n\ntl;dr: my neighbour\u2019s dog is absolutely obsessed/in love with my cat for reasons that I\u2019m not sure of.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Pets", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6o", "subreddit_subscribers": 73291, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why is my neighbour's dog so fixated on my cat?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/9n0kyu/why_is_my_neighbours_dog_so_fixated_on_my_cat/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
