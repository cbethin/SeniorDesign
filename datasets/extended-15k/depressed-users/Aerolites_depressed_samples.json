I've been diagnosed with major depression as well as GAD. Last year, I transferred to a university to continue my bachelors of nursing. I felt very out of place as this was the next phase of my life. I have always had chronic feelings of emptiness. My hardest time in my life would be last year. I pursued a relationship with a guy that I had genuine feelings for. Long story short, I met his close friends. In a situation that involved me excusing myself because of anxiety, they told him that I was a waste of time and space in his life. They thought that I left the setting because of them, but really I just wasn't comfortable. Because they grew up in a more well off area, they labeled me as a \"low life bitch\" as they knew I grew up impoverished. I go to a good uni, but I've seeked out a lot of scholarships. To them, I was a fraud. I know this because this is what the guy relayed to me. The relationship was strained, because he valued his friends more than me. Fast fwd a few more weeks, he ended it with me in the midst of the worst time of my life. My dad was in the hospital, I was failing nursing school with lots of debt to my name and I was malnourished as I couldn't stomach anything. \n\nI would spend most days in bed. Sometimes, I would cry and other times I would just stare at the ceiling. When I was at school, I would frequently excuse myself to schedule a cry in the bathroom. Perhaps it was the grief of losing him combined with other factors, but it was too much for me. The pain was too much.. I wanted to die. \n\nI attempted suicide for the first time in my life via OD.. I ended up throwing up all the pills and I phoned my sister afterwards. She took me in for a few days, took me to school and cleaned me up. I realized, if I couldn't live for myself, I'd do it for my family. \n\nI went to my school adviser and confided in her that I was feeling suicidal. She told the Dean of Nursing and she put out a wellness check on me. This was nice because I felt like other people had genuinely cared about me. It meant a lot. \n\nI ended up getting back with the guy because he missed me, and he realized that the situation was bullshit. I had a lot of hesitancy to do so but I was truly lonely. I just wanted to be loved. I think that I deserve more. \n\nEven though we are still together now, I still feel emptiness. There's this void in myself that I cannot fill with anything - family, friends, lovers.. But the only thing that has changed is my motivation to help others. I'd rather be depressed with goals than the alternative. I hope that I can be happy one day. I hope that my depression allows me to accept who I am fully. I hope that depression won't be the reason for my death. \n\nI sent this email to my counselor as she asked for an update. I am starting to feel a lot better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDear \\_\\_\\_, \n\nIt has been a while since we've last seen each other, but in these last few months, a lot changed. For a while now, I've been feeling empty and numb to everything and everyone around me. I was very depressed when I saw you in January. So much so, that I wanted to end my life because the pain of feeling unloved, abandonment and academic failure pushed me to the edge of execution. The thing is, I've always suffered\u00a0from chronic depression but it was never worth it to proceed with the suicidal ideations. I told myself that I needed to get some serious help because I was going to lose my life if I kept living like this. Unironically, the quarter was centered upon mental health. The clinical experience was amazing as I got to connect with individuals that were suffering like me. Of course from a nursing student perspective, I did not speak about my depression. However, listening to those experiences created a silver lining in my journey - that I wanted to live. I hear the saying, \"suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem\". I never understood that phrase. For years, I have lived in silence to preserve the reality of my situation, a defense mechanism, probably.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, fast forward to summer. Much stress was relieved when I passed my classes and got out of academic probation. However, not being busy anymore has left me at home reminiscent of the dark times I've endured earlier this year. I went to a psychiatrist, and he prescribed me 300 mg of Wellbutrin. I do feel better. And I am excited and motivated about reproductive health. In Jan, I had told you about my situation regarding (current BF's) friends attacking me. They saw me as a joke, because I grew up on food stamps, that I was underprivileged, incapable of success. (bf) broke up with me in Jan shortly after those opinions were heard. It made me almost believe that I was incompetent to be a future nurse. Anyways, that's whole 'nother story that isn't even worth talking about because those people are irrelevant. People have tried to bring me down for years, and I spent years circling on thoughts that I wasn't good enough. But loved ones and respectful peers have supported me through this journey to say.. I am good enough.\u00a0That being said, I now realize that I make my own happiness and I've made it here all on my own. I am excited for the future. Thank you for being my confidante, thank you always.\u00a0\n\n\\- S", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 390794, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Email I Sent to My Adviser", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9jjmnz/email_i_sent_to_my_adviser/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Aerolites", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1533590480, "domain": "self.Aerolites", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Aerolites/comments/955c06/fake_friends/", "id": "955c06", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/u_Aerolites/comments/955c06/fake_friends/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1533590481, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm a 24 year old college student diagnosed with GAD and ADHD.

We mostly hang out with his social group, which consist of seven or eight friends. These individuals are good people, however, I don't feel like myself most of the time. I'm more introverted and quiet. When we go out, I feel obligated to speak, to drink, to do things that I'm not comfortable with. We don't click. I feel like I'm trying to win their approval to win my boyfriend's approval. He has made it clear that he values his friends as much as he does with me. Knowing this, I still pursued him. I'm constantly watching myself, my actions and my words to others. This heightens my anxiety and no one understands as they say \"just be yourself\". \n\nThere was this instance where I actually opened up to one of them, \"K\" about mental illness and how it impacts my relationship. She immediately treats me differently and shuns me out of social gatherings. It's a passive aggressiveness that makes me question myself \"did I do something wrong?\" or \"is it my anxiety that makes me question my ability to make friends?\" I'm gaslighting myself on a self-conscious level. It makes me feel depressed that I have to fill a facade to impress others. \n", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "u_Aerolites", "subreddit_id": "t5_dsmmm", "subreddit_subscribers": 0, "subreddit_type": "user", "suggested_sort": "qa", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Fake Friends", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Aerolites/comments/955c06/fake_friends/"}, {"author": "Aerolites", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1494865269, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6bbd65/physically_in_pain_from_losing_someone/", "id": "6bbd65", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/6bbd65/physically_in_pain_from_losing_someone/", "retrieved_on": 1497143505, "score": 3, "selftext": "I feel like everyone I love is going to eventually leave me because I am just not a likable person when it comes to my attitude.. Yesterday was a great day on paper but going through it all was hell. Got out of a serious relationship recently and I know that heartbreak is normal but I don't think anyone can sense the pain I feel in my body. They would have to physically be in my body to feel it. \n\nI went to a transfer center yesterday to check out my new school and I was meeting all these wonderful people and they were really excited to meet me, know what my interests were, etc. but I just couldn't find myself to be joyful. I sat there at the table until there was one person left. He looked at me and asked why I was so serious. I looked at him and I couldn't hold it in anymore, I bawled so hard. Broke down in the middle of the cafeteria, but he comforted me. The whole transition of moving in another phase of my life was so fucking overwhelming without him since he helped me get this far but I couldn't imagine doing it without him. \n\nMy emotions feel like I'm dying and I can't explain all these feelings of abandonment. I just want to die. I know I have a future ahead of me but how is success worth it if the one I love isn't there with me? There were so many memories that took two specific people in a particular time that made life so beautiful and worth living every time I thought about those times. I lost more than him, I lost everything he brought to my life. I can't sleep, I don't even have an appetite. I'm thinking of ways to kill myself and the hardest thing is keeping myself from dialing him. It's the hardest thing I've ever done and I'm being forced to be upfront with my inner demons of being truly alone. \n\nBefore I met him I was depressed, he made it go away, now he's gone and this is the worst I've ever felt. I know I made the rookie mistake of starting a relationship while depressed but he was the best thing that has ever happened to me and Everytime I wake up I feel pathetic, crouch into a ball and cry until I can't cry anymore. It hurts, physically. Every fiber of my being feels like it's ripped open with excruciating pain.

My therapist recommended that I reach out to old friends, to see if we can organically build a friendship that I desperately needed in my life. There was this particular girl \"M\" I knew since middle school, and throughout the years we would reconnect briefly and go our separate ways. \n\nI decided to contact \"M\" and it turns out we had a lot in common and since she was a wild child, she took me out often and we had a great time. Over time, I was happier knowing that someone had cared about me and wanted to do things with me. One time she asked if I could cover dinner, and I did.. and I didn't mind.. and then it kept happening for small things. She needed favors so constantly, and I went out of my way to help her out. I was so blind, I've never been used before so I didn't know that she was basically lying to my face about everything-- our friendship.. our times together. \n\nThe funny thing was that I told her I was struggling with depression and having a friend through this tough time meant a lot. She took this as a sign of weakness to validate her control over me. The final straw was when we had plans to meet at a restaurant for my birthday, and she flaked on the last second knowing I was at the place, alone.. I would have helped her with school, money or a job too. I don't know what I did to deserve this but my chest feels heavy and I can't cry. I wanted a friend so bad, and the worst part is that she probably doesn't give a fuck. I want to die, but having these thoughts drag me down so much. I love my job and my family but depression is keeping me from being who I need to be.

Time to lock the door and run the faucet. I'm so tired of being tired. And I'm older now. I don't want you in my life but somehow a part of me still yearns for that motherly love and approval.

I want you to die. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "UnsentLetters", "subreddit_id": "t5_2seir", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dear T", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/5lp1dg/dear_t/"}, {"author": "Aerolites", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1482744002, "domain": "self.insomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/5kczx5/am_i_going_crazy/", "id": "5kczx5", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/insomnia/comments/5kczx5/am_i_going_crazy/", "retrieved_on": 1484442535, "score": 3, "selftext": "Background info:\n\nI'm 23 years old female who has been suffering from insomnia for a few months, off and on antidepressants (Prozac mainly). I usually don't fall asleep around 3 am and wake up at 8 am to work. Usually exhausted in the middle of the day but appetite picks up around 6 pm or so. I am wide awake until I sleep at 3 am and sometimes I stay awake the whole night. I feel that my body has gotten used to this cycle as I don't feel stressed out with the lack of sleep when I am working long hours but as of lately, it's as though I've lost touch with reality.\n\nA week ago I've been reading into psychedelic/psychoactive drugs to see if that was an option. I read pages and pages about people's experiences because it was something so very fascinating to me. I went to sleep that night after reading a long article on MDMA. \n\nThroughout the whole night there were a couple of times where I felt shocks, stared at the ceiling and had the overwhelming feeling of happiness and joy-- and I have never tried hallucinogens in my life. I'm not sure if I was awake or asleep when it happened, it just felt so real and lasting, I liked it almost. I woke up that morning, almost like I felt no emotion about anything anymore.. all the worries that caused me pain in the past was gone and I really felt that I was letting go of silly things that made me upset. \n\nI went off Prozac (50g a week) almost immediately because I had felt so confident in myself that I had beat depression, but the insomnia was still there. \n\nNow that I'm off my medication my life has changed tremendously, I feel that I don't need sleep anymore, that I function fine without it. However, I get easily upset at things that didn't affect me before. Also, I've become less social at work and with friends/family. BUT me as a person, has become a lot happier than before. MY QUESTIONS ARE: Is this normal? How is it possible to combat years of depression in one single night of what seemingly was a total surreal and unexplained experience? Is the lack of sleep really that big of a problem in the long run? \n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "insomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3g", "thumbnail": "self", "title":

These last few months have been the best in my life and that's really all I can ask for. \n\nBefore we were together, we were such good friends. You were so cool, smart and poised. I eventually became so drawn to you, admiring your fascinating personality and overall positivity. Something you didn't know about me before was that you saved me. I was stuck in a dark place and you were the light of it all. You were the only person that accepted me for who I truly was, not the artificial life I was living in an attempt to be classified as \"normal\". You taught me that it was okay to be myself, that it was okay to ask for help and that we would see through it together. \n\nI eventually found myself falling for you and I truly felt feelings of enchantment towards you. I relished the time we spent together. I loved spending late nights with you, gawking at others and laughing. I will never forget those moments. You made me smile, cry tears of joy, and overall made me a very happy person. You saw through my imperfections, my ugliness and my terrible sense of direction. I will never forget the time you liked me back. For the first time in my life, I felt content with just being me. \n\nFor days I pondered at the reason why you felt so attracted to me. I was just someone struggling just to get by in life. Everyday I would wake up and stare at myself in the mirror for the longest time. I wanted to see what you saw. How could you notice me?  I couldn't figure it out but it was just only you that mattered to me. \n\nYou made me into a better person, D and before you I don't think I could have ever said that and meant it. I was no longer angry at myself, or the world. I eventually came out of a long period of misery and self harm. I couldn't have done it without your help. You made me believe things that I once thought were all lies. I found myself in a very vulnerable position but I trusted you with my heart not to destroy me with just a few words. It was a scary thought, but you comforted me.\n\nYou didn't need me but I needed you and you understood that. I made the mistake of calling it love too early, and I'm sorry. The truth is, I want to be in love with you more than anything. \n\nWe were more different than I thought. You had your future, and I just had you. I just wish I hadn't met someone as good as you this early on in life because I'll probably have to find some kind of quality similar to yours in every guy I find a liking in.\n\nLooking back, I'm glad you chose me to be the one to make you happy.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "UnsentLetters", "subreddit_id": "t5_2seir", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "D.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/18t6h8/d/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "Aerolites", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1360499636, "domain": "self.depression", "edited": 1361169689, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/188t86/questioning_my_own_self_worth/", "id": "188t86", "is_self": true, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/188t86/questioning_my_own_self_worth/", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1413086960, "score": 3, "selftext": "I need to get this off my chest, it's killing me and I can't make sense of anything right now. \n\nA few months ago I was on the deeper end of depression and now I find myself desperately looking for answers of just \"why?\" \n\nWhile I was in this depression phase of my life I met this wonderful person and we became so close, to the point where I shared every aspect of my life with him. I didn't speak to him for a month because I started to like him a lot, and I was scared of rejection. After a month we were casually talking one day and I told him the only reason why we ever stopped talking, was because I secretly liked him. He returned these feelings and I finally feel amazing for the first time in a while. \n\nHe understood me, he didn't judge me and told me in these exact words \"don't worry we're going to get through this together.\" I believed him. I felt like he was protecting me from everything. I've had abandonment issues my whole life therefore it meant a lot to me that he was willing to like me, for me. For a while, I pondered over as to why I was so lucky to be with someone so perfect. \n\nDuring my relationship with him I was finally starting to figure out who I was. I even went to school for the first time, and my grades were amazing because he was my motivation for everything. I could see myself with him in the future. I eventually accepted a job offering just to be closer to him. With all these plans for the future, I found myself so dangerously attached to him. I did everything to make him happy because he would do the same. It was great. It was a feeling I'll never forget. \n\nOne day he completely ignores me and tells me it's because of school and such. I understood that and gave him space. Later on he dropped everything with me. Everytime I texted him, messaged him on skype, he would ignore me. He was clearly shutting me out of his life. \n\nI'm tearing up as I write this because he doesn't even care. I can't.. even think of a reason why he'd want to hurt me. He told me all these things, all these promises and I don't want to believe it was just a lie. And there's nothing. Just me crying and being frustrated as to why I was so betrayed to think this person listened to me, watched movies with me, comforted me, and basically cared for me. \n\nI just don't know who I am anymore. I feel like I'm inside an empty body. It hurts so much to breathe. I seriously can't see myself as someone who deserves to be \"loved\" because everyone close in my life has been a lie. \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Questioning my own self worth", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/188t86/questioning_my_own_self_worth/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "Aerolites", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1359212149, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyPMs/comments/17be39/its_just_hormones_you_know/", "id": "17be39", "is_self": false, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 83, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/creepyPMs/comments/17be39/its_just_hormones_you_know/", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1413160071, "score": 203, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "creepyPMs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ug83", "thumbnail": "http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dqRGm9SUyC5n4fnn.jpg", "title": "It's just hormones, you know?", "url": "http://imgur.com/a/oRQbu", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "Aerolites", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1358776580, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16zkrn/today_i_realized_something_important/", "id": "16zkrn", "is_self": true, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/16zkrn/today_i_realized_something_important/", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1413177979, "score": 21, "selftext": "I would like to thank reddit for helping me cope with my depression. I seriously don't know where I'd be without such a great community from /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch. \n\nAfter months of self harm and mental breakdowns, I can safely say today I woke up feeling great about myself. If this was me months ago, or even a week ago, I would be the opposite. I would always be drowning in my own self-pity and just be overly emotional about everything.  \n\nToday I had a chat with a close friend before I woke up and something hit me. I'm lucky to be where I am today. Why am I giving it all up? All my life, I've been so spoiled, thinking everything would fall into place. But what I came to realize is that, I have to be the one that gets up in the morning to take a shower, eat, be productive, make something out of myself. I just push people away that are willing to help. \n\nNow I'm not saying I'm a totally changed person, because I don't think that at all. Today something in my head just clicked, and right now I want to be better. Overtime, I learned to value what I have now, and it really helped me open my eyes to what I can potentially accomplish in my life. I want to live again. I love my family, my friends, and my boyfriend. I don't want to be selfish anymore. I know there aren't going to be perfect days. But there aren't going to be days where I can barely get up under the covers. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that, those of you that are struggling through depression: Depression takes so much of you. Your energy, your thoughts, your motivation. I've attempted suicide once, hurt myself at least numerous times, was ashamed of who I was, and thought about suicide almost everyday. And I've been through this for about a little less than a year. But a week ago, I had a symbolic dream. I was running through a dark place from the \"bad\" and I didn't know where to go. I was lost and scared. I then found myself from the past from when I was 9. I wouldn't consider it a nightmare because in the end I discovered that I wasn't lost anymore. It was always in myself to find the way out. And that is what depression really is. You're lost, stuck in a place where you don't know where or what to do but there's always an exit at the end. What I discovered throughout this whole experience is that, it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to admit that you have a problem. I come from a traditional and strict family, so it was hard for me to come out to my parents. But in the end all they ever wanted for me was to seek help. I see my psychiatrist first thing in the morning tomorrow.\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading my story. I really do hope you all get help and I'll always be here to lend an ear. I love you all.
