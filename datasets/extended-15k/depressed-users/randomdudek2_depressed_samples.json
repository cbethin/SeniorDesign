HUGE depression shit-show over here \ud83d\udd90\ud83e\udd19. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety, MDD (3 times), and ADHD (2 times). I got diagnosed with adhd and depression once again 2 months ago as I was taken to the hospital in a lovely ambulance because my life has been just fucking jolly to this point. Long story short, I got started on medications but the depression still plagues every breathing moment i experience and i reach the point daily where it feels like rock bottom's hell hole. I've tried around 6 different meds for depression and I've tried 5 for anxiety. At this point I dont know what to do. I'm deciding between Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Electroconvulsive Therapy. I'm looking for opinions about the two if we ignore the price of them. Anything helps. Thanks in advance. Oh, and if you also live a life where you fucking live in a pointless world of hate and hell then at least you can know you're not alone. What a damn fine fucking time to be alive.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 396225, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Personal Opinions", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9o8kwu/personal_opinions/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "randomdudek2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1529961343, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8tu8ro/just_a_guy_reaching_out_for_help/", "id": "8tu8ro", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/8tu8ro/just_a_guy_reaching_out_for_help/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1529961345, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Ok, so I just downloaded reddit so i dont really know how all this works. But I'll try this. So I'm depressed. Very depressed.  I have been suicidal for a few weeks and went to the emergency room for it 5 days ago and they just made someone take my gun and rope away and sent me away. I've been alone since then. I tried calling everyone i know so i am not alone but nobody \"has time\" and nobody would be able to talk, even after they heard about what has been going on. I'm 19 years old. My brother tries to kill himself in prison. He will be in there for another 2 years. My mom just got out of the hospital not long ago from cutting herself and being depressed.  My girlfriend who I still love so extremely much did a bunch of things that really hurt me... cheated on me, lied to me about giving herself out to other guys, and I gave her many second chances and was there for her. But she just barely pushed me away and practically told me to get out of her life. I have nobody. I dont WANT to do anything. I go to crisis centers but i just dont want to do anything they say. I just want to be done. I'm just reaching out here to see what everyone has to say if anyone is reading this... I'm planning to go buy what I need in an hour or so... hopefully by tonight I'll be feeling better or experiencing the next phase of being. Thanks everyone.
