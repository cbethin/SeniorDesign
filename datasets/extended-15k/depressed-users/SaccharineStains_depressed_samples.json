I went back to the doctors a few months ago because it was getting out of hand again, so I really wanted someone to talk to. They had to put me back through the entire process again, I was obviously diagnosed with depression and anxiety (which I knew I already had from previous diagnoses), but they also told me I also have bipolar disorder. Now, I really didn't find it surprising after I sat down and really thought about things and the signs of it. But, they wanted to medicate me for it but I declined because I hate living in a constant fog like state that all medications seem to put me though. With all that being said, tonight I had a really bad episode.\n\n Let me mind you, I've been doing really well. I haven't been as depressed as normal and my mood swings have been manageable, but this was the worst I've been in months. It started off as a panic attack, tight chest, unable to breath, hyperventilating, the whole nine yards. But, something that I've never done before was hit my palm against my forehead.  I thought I had only did it once, but I guess I did it more than once because there's a bump on my forehead.\n\n Today has been a really really bad day, from different aspects just piling on top of each other, but I didn't think I'd break as badly as I did tonight. The thing with the bipolar disorder is that sometimes I feel like there's a physical switch in me, like a light switch and it just happens. I have no warning.  It's just scary because I constantly wish to just be normal, I understand there's no \"actual normal\" but there must be something better than this. \n\nHaving a slip like this makes me extremely anxious because I fear going back to how I used to be. I wanted to vent this so badly, I vented to a friend and anytime they do they always say \"Go get help,\" but it's not that simple. I know I'm not the only one who avoids professional help because of the fear of being put away for a little bit again. (I know I'm not at that extent because I am very clear minded now, but either way I really want to avoid that)\n\nIt's so hard to talk about it because of the burden it puts on others, or the fear that they'll reject you because of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, here I am, venting about it.

His flight here was a disaster, there was a terrible delay that fortunately we were able to make it a little better than what it was sought out to be. \n\nMy drive to the airport I was extremely jittery and excited - which only escalated when I was waiting for him at the terminal. Finally, I saw him coming out of the tram area and knew it was him. My heart felt like it was going to actually breakthrough my chest. Wrapping my arms around him for the first time felt like it was where I was meant to be, you know? I've never felt so completely comfortable with someone in such a short span of time. \n\nWe got to spend a few days in my area, Tampa, before heading to Orlando for the rest of his stay with me. I took him to the Aquarium we have in downtown Tampa, which was really nice just spending time with him in a beautiful place. The next morning, we left for Orlando which our biggest plan was to spend the day in Disney. \n\nI thought the Aquarium was amazing, but nothing tops Disney - especially when you're with someone who you love. I have never laughed so much with someone, I felt like every moment there was something more to laugh about. Spending time with him anywhere would have been perfect. You know someone is fun to be around if they make the hall of presidents in Magic Kingdom enjoyable. Anywhere he went with me was fun. Eating with him was fun, watching TV with him was fun. No matter what we were doing I enjoyed every second of it. At night, I felt like it was a waste to sleep because I didn't want to spend a moment that wasn't laughing or talking with him.\n\nSaying goodbye was difficult, my eyelids have still not recovered from how much I had to wipe them dry. Now knowing how hard it is to let him slip from my arms to go home, it's easier when we have another date to look forward to. So, a few days after he had left, with tear filled eyes, we planned his second visit down and unofficially began planning my trip up to him in Maine. I know we're meant to be together, and I just really wanted to share this first time meeting success story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to not gush &amp; make this too long but I cannot express how happy and full my heart is with him in my life.\n\nI cannot wait to see him, touch him and kiss him again in October. 41 more days.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LongDistance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s6ky", "subreddit_subscribers": 61942, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (22/F) experience meeting my (20/M) boyfriend for the first time!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/99j583/my_22f_experience_meeting_my_20m_boyfriend_for/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "SaccharineStains", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1533859075, "domain": "self.LongDistance", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/961v19/less_than_15_minuets_until_i_22f_and_my_so_m20/", "id": "961v19", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/LongDistance/comments/961v19/less_than_15_minuets_until_i_22f_and_my_so_m20/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1533859077, "score": 1, "selftext": "My heart is literally pounding through my chest - I\u2019m so excited and wanted to share it!!

I do have some questions regarding how protected I am.\nI\u2019ve been pretty good with taking the pill on time - late by no more than 40- 1 1/2 hours less than three times. \n1.) how protected am I? If actions are unprotected and the partner happens to not pull out - will I be protected  hypothetically? I understand there\u2019s the 1% chance and what nots. \n2.) what\u2019s the best way to track if I\u2019m protected?\n\nThat\u2019s about all I can think of right now - thank you in advance!!!

You may not recognize the person on the phone, my voice might be different, I may even carry myself differently verbally. What I hope for the most is that you'd be proud of who you spoke to.\n\nIt's been three years, when I thought it was only one. It's been three. I was only nineteen, I had no intention of living a life without you in it - not until I was old myself, because of course, we aren't immortal and death is a part of reality. I thought you'd be there at my wedding, meeting my first child - maybe even my second or third. I'd want you to be the figure that you were to me, to them. \n\nThroughout my life you guided and cradled me in ways I cannot repay you for. When no one was on my side or understood me, somehow you always found a way to. Almost as if you knew the translations to my language before I even did myself. \n\nMy family fell apart quickly, bricks flying left and right as the explosion hit us suddenly. My world was crashing down and I didn't even know it because I was just a child - but yet there you were, blinding me from what was right in front of me. Keeping me guarded the best way you could while my parents fought desperately to keep us from falling apart.  You constantly gave to us, not only myself but my brother. The one who held the ticking-time bomb that eventually sent our lives in a spiral. You took someone in who was left for nothing, you rebuilt him, helped shaping him into the man he is today. Without you, I may not even have a brother to call mine anymore. I may not have the niece and nephew I love so dearly - the small children I am able to love because you taught me how to love a niece/nephew by how you loved me. \n\nMy aspirations in life weren't normal to everyone else, but you still stuck by my side and told me that it was exactly what I was made to do, regardless of what anyone thought. My own parents turned their back on me and my choices, but you stood tall with your hand in mine - keeping me afloat the best way you could. I wish I could tell you that I decided to change my major - but stuck with the same focus point. You'd be proud because ultimately it was the most mature decision I could have made. I would have never had the guts or courage to pursue anything without the confidence you've given me from a young age. \n\nI have so much thanks to give that's shadowed by sorrow because I was cheated. It's selfish to say that I was cheated - because I know that many others who love you feel the same way. Being the second youngest cousin, I had the least amount of time with you, for some reason I blame my parents deep down for not having me sooner.\n\nI resent my parents; knowing you would disapprove of this because they may have did the right thing. They never told me you were sick, no one told me for that matter. Not a single cousin, family friend, no one told me a single thing. My feelings were in their hearts - considering while your health was declining rapidly, so was my grandfather's. Both of you fighting a battle that eventually you'd lose. All of the battles you fought with me, I owed it to you to fight this one with you - but I wasn't even on the sidelines; I wasn't even in the audience. I was nowhere to be found because I was unaware of what was happening. Leaving a lump in my throat as I type the question, unable to process if you knew if I was aware of your condition. If you knew that I did not know, or if you told them to not tell me. \n\nIt's selfish - because not only was I left out of this, but so were you and so was my Grandfather. A Triangle of questions forever left unanswered. He wondered why you didn't call and you asked the same question - did you also wonder where I was, too? Constantly left in the dark, unsure of where you were for months when it turns out you were in a medically induced coma. My grandfather cursing your name under his breath for not reaching out to him - your father figure who was dying of cancer at an alarming rate. \n\nWould it have been better if we all knew what was happening? I just wanted one last conversation with you. One more, because the last I had was unfair and short. You were tired, I understand now.. but you never mentioned how sick you were.\n\n\"I can't believe Grandpa passed away, I'm sorry I'm not there for you. I miss you, please call me more.\" it was short, but you asked me to call. I wanted to call.. I planned on calling, but I didn't get a weeks time without getting the message of you passing. I didn't get seven days time... three of which you weren't able to speak as you slipped into a deep sleep. I wrote you a thank you, a cousin read it to you - or I hope she read it to you. For someone who had such an impact on my life, what words can even be written or said to them? I wanted to hold you, I wanted you to hold me. Just once, not for long, just a second if that's all I could possibly have. \n\nI want to tell you how happy I've became recently - how waking up doesn't ache as much. Sometimes I think colors are even brighter. The sun isn't as hot and the world is more tolerable. A smile almost never leaves my face. There's new people in my life and I wish you could see who was contributing to my happiness. I wish you could meet who I am now, see who I've grown into. Meet my nephew and my niece you met when she was still so small. Imagining her growing up without hearing the laugh that filled a room with smiles in the matter of seconds. Meeting the woman who shaped me into the woman I am, it's almost unthinkable. \n\nThis is long, but there's so many more things I wish I could say.\n\nI'm so sorry I wasn't there.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI love you.\n\nPlease continue to watch over me. \n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nLove always,\n\nWoo.

It's definitely helpful knowing that there are others out there with the same kind of love.\n\nI \\[F/22\\] am meeting my boyfriend \\[M/20\\] for the first time on August 9th. I'm extremely excited and surprisingly not as nervous as I thought I'd be at this time. I feel like I've known him my entire life - everything comes naturally with him.\n\n A little backstory:\n\nI currently live in the Tampa area of Florida and he currently lives in Maine! We're super fortunate to be in the same time zone together, it definitely makes it easier to spend time with one another. It was a quick connection; there wasn't any doubt about it. It started out as getting excited when I got a message from him to my heart literally exploding anytime my phone vibrated in the hopes it was him. My feelings were strong for him right off the bat and grew intensely as time went on - which was totally mutual! His qualities are everything I've always needed in my life and to find that in a person is so rare. It's almost like when you think you lost the last puzzle piece to complete the picture - but you find it where you least expect it. With that being said, we didn't really waste a lot of time with talking about future plans and visits. We recently planned our visit a month in advance just because we're both so eager.\n\nWe'll be staying at my house for a few days before heading to Orlando we're we'll be going to Disney for the day. It's super exciting to get to take him around the area and show him everything - even though the area I reside in isn't the most entertaining, I'm just looking forward to being able to spend time with him. As excited as I am, I can't help but think about the last day we'll have together when he gets back on the plane to go back home. It's going to be really difficult to have someone you love in your arms one day and the distance back the next. But, we'll be talking about our next visit when he comes down here, too.\n\nEither way, I'm super excited and cannot wait. 29 days to go!
