All self-inflicted. And those are just the ones still visible. Noone seems to give a fuck. My mom told me I was faking how bad it was, and that I'm lying about feeling suicidal. I've already tried to kill myself by ODing on my antidepressants. Didn't work unfortunately.\n\nMy grades are non-existant. The teachers just say to \"cheer up\" and that \"it's not as bad as you think\". I wish people could actually help and care, rather than giving me the same responses over and over again, only adding to my depressive state.\n\nI told my close friend I was thinking about suicide. Instead of helping, she made me feel guilty and made me feel like a piece of shit. I feel like by the time I'm 20, I'll heal dead from suicide, and if I'm not I'll be even worse than I am now and without a job or home. Enough ranting, I'm just going to get back to the endless cycle of pain.

My girlfriend has been dating me for about a year. 2 months into the relationship i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. She helped me out with it, and I was getting a little happy for about 5 months. Then she cheated with her ex. I forgave her, cut myself and cried myself to sleep to get over it. Another month, another man she was fucking. Forgave her again because I'm fucking stupid. 2 months later, some more cheating. Now I'm fucking emotionally crippled. Can't leave her because she'll kill herself. I probably will too. Our relationship is a constant cycle of fucking cutting ourselves, fucking each other out of hate and sadness and wanting to die.
