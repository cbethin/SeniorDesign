This is my first time reaching out for help online. I've never used reddit before or any forum so sorry if I do something incorrectly. I am 21 years old and was diagnosed at 19 with depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia. When I was diagnosed, I was high functioning. I was a college student, had a full time job, friends, and a longterm relationship. All of that ended 6 months ago when I moved to another state with my family. I lost my job, friends, and relationship. I am having an extremely hard time digging myself out of this hole. I can't bring myself to register for classes to continue college or apply for jobs due to my extreme anxiety. I don't have a driver's license as driving gives me panic attacks. My only coping mechanism is extreme daydreaming. 6-8 hours a day. I did some research and it is called maladaptive daydreaming. I can't stop. It has taken over my life. I have given up on my hobbies, dreams, and ambitions. I used to be very motivated and hard working. Now, I have no desire to do anything but live in my fantasy world. If anyone can please offer some insight or help I would greatly appreciate it.
