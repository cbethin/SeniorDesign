Everything in my life is amazing except I was let go from my job a year ago and I am completely broke. I don't know how I'm going to pay rent and bills next month and we're days away from October. I'm scared my boyfriend is going to think I'm pathetic and that I can't take care of myself and he'll dump me. I get gigs here and there but I cannot find a job. I went to a really good college, had a great career lining up for myself and it's all just gone. \n\nMy year has been hard besides money and job. I'm diagnosed BP2 and have been on Lamictal for about 8 years which has worked wonderfully. I got new health insurance after I lost my job and the new pdoc is a moron. He put me on welbutrin also which literally made me go insane. I couldn't stop throwing up and lost 16 pounds in three months (I'm already really skinny). I was horrible and angry at everyone and everything. I wanted to kill myself everyday for those three months. I attempted suicide after my boyfriend and I got in a fight. I stole his Xanax and downed the rest of the bottle. He found me on his bathroom floor and took me to the ER where I was held on a psych watch. That was in May. I went off Welbutrin immediately after being discharged and had two months of horrible withdrawals. I had seizures and would just start yelling and crying. I felt like a puppet on someone else's hand. I couldn't control my emotions. Suicide is extra triggering for me because my mom commit suicide when I was 16. \n\nThings have gotten progressively better throughout the rest of summer up until now. I'm happier, stable, I have amazing people around me. I have an awesome dad, the most amazing and supportive boyfriend, amazing friends. The only thing destroying my life is money and work. I'm 28 and decided I don't want to work in the field I was working in after graduating and I feel like a child. I can't fend for myself or take care of myself. My boyfriend is older and more established and I'm so insecure being in this position. I don't want him to leave me. \n\nToday is the first day I've revisited thinking about suicide. I'm not going to, I have a lot to lose, but I do feel completely hopeless.
