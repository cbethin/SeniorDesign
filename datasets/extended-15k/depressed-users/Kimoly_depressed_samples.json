My life has always been messed up but now I'm at a point where I don't know how to go on... \n\nFor the first few months I was constantly searching for positive feelings. I was asking myself all the time how I know I'm in love, what being in a relationship is supposed to be like etc. I googled a lot. My mind is preoccupied with this relationship. \n\nI was told about sexual attraction and I still don't know if I'm asexual or if my SO and I are lacking something. I don't know how you identify sexual attraction... My mind made the connection: good looks = instant sexual attraction, which lead me to run around and look at men (or women) to see if I notice something. But I don't, I guess. \n\nThis sexual attraction thing led me to believe my SO looks ugly. I don't know if it's an intrusive thought or the truth. I really don't like his haircut, my mind keeps obsessing about his hair as if it's the only thing he's made of. When the lightning is bad, the dark circles around his eyes look even worse. Then I'm afraid to look at him because it makes him look very unattractive and then my mind keeps obsessing about that. :( :( :( It's awful. \nWhen the lightning is good I think he's cute. \n\nAt some point I found out about rocd, which was a huge relief, but I still don't know if it's really that or if I'm just in the wrong relationship. :( \n\nLogically I don't understand how I can go from sexual dreams of someone and being eager to meet someone, even thinking you love them (BEFORE being in a relationship with them!!) to thinking they're ugly and obsessing about their looks. Is this part of depression? Or just rocd? \n\nI can't deal with this, I'm mentally exhausted from thinking. ;( \n\nI wish we could be best friends again. It's really selfish of me to think that but then he'd still be there, I could still care about him but I wouldn't have to think about his looks and attraction all the time. :( It's too much for me. \n\nWithout him I'm alone here... and I'm afraid this will lead to suicidal thoughts... \n\nI feel like starting this relationship was really a bad idea, it lead to so much pain... I guess my low self-esteem is a huge problem. \n\n**tldr; suffer from a lot of mental illnesses, can't cope with being in a/this relationship, feel mentally exhausted, wish we could be best friends again..**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "subreddit_subscribers": 1732005, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm (25F) mentally exhausted from being in a relationship", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9qdga8/im_25f_mentally_exhausted_from_being_in_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Kimoly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1tmj6zz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1540122065, "crosspost_parent": "t3_9q2trm", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "Kimoly", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1tmj6zz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1540150104.0, "created_utc": 1540121304.0, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.ROCD", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "9q2trm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_9q2trm", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "permalink": "/r/ROCD/comments/9q2trm/i_cant_cope_with_all_of_this/", "pinned": false, "pwls": null, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey guys, \n\nThis whole year has been so awful.

Now I don't like kissing at all and could go without it my entire life. :l", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 387677, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "No feelings while kissing", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9gt71q/no_feelings_while_kissing/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Kimoly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1tmj6zz", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537261091, "domain": "self.AskReddit", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9gt529/what_do_you_think_of_the_statement_attraction_is/", "id": "9gt529", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9gt529/what_do_you_think_of_the_statement_attraction_is/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537261091, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "subreddit_subscribers": 20127021, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What do you think of the statement \"Attraction is not (so) important in a relationship if you've got an emotional connection\"?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9gt529/what_do_you_think_of_the_statement_attraction_is/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Kimoly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1533214530, "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/93z0vz/do_you_like_everything_about_so/", "id": "93z0vz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/93z0vz/do_you_like_everything_about_so/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1533214532, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Open Question.

I don\u2018t know what\u2018s right or wrong. It\u2018s so confusing. \n\n\nIt\u2018s my first relationship ever. I have a huge problem with humans and human intimacy because I wasn\u2018t raised that way, my mother liked hitting me in the face more than hugging me (something she never did). I guess the way I was brought up is also the reason why I have so many problems with myself, I have huge problems with my self-esteem for example. I hate myself, I hate the way I look and I don\u2018t understand how anyone could ever like/love me. \u2026 \n\n\n\nIt\u2018s just: I have an amazing boyfriend. He\u2018s such a great guy, he\u2018s unbelievably understanding, I love this voice (don\u2018t know why), I like his height, I like his character, he\u2018s very intelligent and worldly-wise. It\u2018s fascinating. He makes me laugh, he\u2018s funny. I love being around him. \nI also feel kinda drawn to him, like I want to be close to him. I like cuddling with him which, like I explained, is unusual for me, to let somebody be so close to me. I often think that this moment would be better if he were with me. I once sat in front of him and thought to myself that I love him, which still confuses me because that was before we were together and that thought really shocked me. I love talking to him because I can be absolutely open to him. We talk about everything. (Which often burdens him because my thoughts are often very negative...) I also care a fucking lot about him and want him to be happy. Sounds good right? Yeah\u2026 \n\n\nIt\u2018s just I normally feel nothing when I kiss him. He\u2018s the first guy I ever kissed so I have no comparison. I had 2 oder 3 kisses with him that were different, where I felt something, I guess. We also didn\u2018t have sex until now although we\u2018re together for half a year now. I\u2018m absolutely scared of it. I\u2018m scared of the pain, of getting pregnant if something goes wrong, of showing myself completely naked\u2026 The idea of having sex with someone makes me afraid. I also have absolutely no desire. I don't know if it would be different with someone else. I have no desire to search for someone else, it's more like: \"Okay, relationships are also something I'm not good at, let's stop doing that.\" \u2026 \n\n\nI don\u2018t know if HE isn\u2018t the right one for me or if I\u2018m the problem. I might have depression or some other mental illness, I\u2018m not diagnosed yet. Lately I kept thinking about things I don\u2018t like about him or at least things that aren\u2018t perfect about him. I\u2018m not even sure if I don\u2018t like it, it just occured to me. His teeth for example aren\u2018t straight. I don\u2018t know if I ever thought about that before\u2026 Someone then asked me if I keep looking for things I don't like about him to have a reason to leave him. It's weird. \n\n\nI don\u2018t know if depression (or something else) can make you only see the negative in other people and not the good things anymore? Like I only see the negative aspects of myself? \n\nI don\u2018t know what to do or think anymore. I feel lost and trapped at the same time. \n\n\n**tldr; I feel drawn towards my bf but I feel mostly nothing when I kiss him and there's no sexual desire (at least not mentally) ; I don't know if my possible depression or another mental illness is the reason or if he's just my best friend**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "subreddit_subscribers": 1370276, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (24F) don't know if my bf (23M) and I are lacking something or if my brain is looking for perfection", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8z4yxe/i_24f_dont_know_if_my_bf_23m_and_i_are_lacking/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Kimoly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_id": "t2_1tmj6zz", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1531590656, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8yv29j/is_hyperventilation_a_part_of_depression/", "id": "8yv29j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/8yv29j/is_hyperventilation_a_part_of_depression/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1531590656, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Do you guys hyperventilate?

He\u2018s the first person I ever kissed and it doesn\u2018t do anything for me. Most of the time. There have been like 2 oder 3 kisses which were different, but I don\u2018t know.. Maybe we\u2018re lacking something or I\u2018m asexual. I don\u2018t know. It\u2018s so confusing. Maybe I\u2018m also blocking myself in some kind of way cuz I have a lot of mental health problems. \u2026 It\u2018s exhausting. I\u2018m not doing well. :( There are so many questions and it seems like nobody can give me an answer. \n\n\nHe\u2018s such a wonderful person. I care so much about his well-being, I love his voice (I don\u2018t know why), I love talking to him and listening to him\u2026 but maybe we\u2018re not right for each other or maybe I\u2018m not right for him. He convinced me that he\u2018s in love with me but I don\u2018t feel like it. It\u2018s like I\u2018m desperately searching for my feelings. Most of the time I just feel nothing, I'm stressed out or I'm anxious. It\u2018s all a bit too much at the moment. :( I\u2018m crying daily because of all of this. \n\n\nI haven\u2018t seen him for a week now, he\u2018s on vacation with his family and I don\u2018t even miss him. That\u2018s something that shows me I\u2018m not in love with him because if I were I\u2018d miss him terribly. It feels like I have some kind of break from this relationship and I feel better right now, like I have time for myself and time to breathe. :( It\u2018s horrible. \u2026 It feels like the relationship is some kind of burden I need to get rid of. It seems like I don't have those kind of feelings my boyfriend always talks about. Or maybe I'm not able to feel them. \n\n\nWe are so alike, it\u2018s unbelievable. I\u2018ve never met someone who understands me so well and with whom I can be so honest with. I can say everything that\u2018s on my mind. It\u2018s amazing. I cherish that a lot. It\u2018s just\u2026 I love cuddling with him, which took some time because I\u2018m not used to human intimacy. But all this sexual stuff isn\u2018t mine. Kissing feels like nothing most of the time. We didn\u2018t have sex until now but I\u2018m really not interested in it. I mean I'd try it, but there isn't any kind of desire... I don\u2018t know if all of this would be different with someone else. I\u2018m not interested in having a relationship ever again because this one already got me down so much which is completely my fault. :( I guess I\u2018ll never find someone like him. I don't know. It feels like he's better off without me. \n\n\nSeems like I should break up with him right? :( I don\u2018t know how. I don\u2018t wanna break his heart, he\u2018s such a wonderful person. Despite that we\u2018d both be alone after the break-up since we don\u2018t have any other friends in this town. I don\u2018t want him to be alone in this situation. I wish I\u2018d be this best friend and someone else would break up with him so I could be there for him. :( It's a painful thought to imagine that he's crying all alone in bed after I broke up with him. :( I'm also scard that maybe I won't feel better after a break-up because the relationship wasn't my main problem but the other things in my life... I can't imagine him not being there. :( \n\nI mean: What should I do IF a break-up was the wrong choice? \nIt\u2018s a horrible situation\u2026 \n\n**TLDR; I guess I have to break up with my bf, but it's complicated.

My BF is absolutely not the problem, he's a wonderful guy. It's completely my fault. At the beginning of our relationship I guess I was happy and excited, because it\u2018s both our first one. I don\u2018t really remember how I felt back then\u2026 He\u2018s also the first guy I ever kissed (since then I\u2018m wondering if I\u2018m asexual). About a month into our relationship my mind started to drive me crazy in a way. I was constantly asking myself: \u201eHow do you know you\u2018re in love? Is this relationship right or wrong? How do I know? How can I be sure?\u201c - it was like it was the only thing I thought about, I wasn\u2018t able to do many other things because my mind was so occupied with thinking about my relationship. This went on for months\u2026 I don\u2018t know how I made it through it. Now for about 2-3 weeks I kinda accepted the thought that I'm not in love and now my mind is \u201efree\u201c. That's so wonderful. It's like there was a storm inside my head before and now it's really quiet. I feel so relieved. But yeah \u2026 I don't know. Now I'm thinking: Were that intrusive thoughts (I was thinking maybe I have rOCD?) or was that my subconscious telling me the truth that I'm not in love and I was in denial for all this time? Can the subconscious be this intrusive? It was so horrible. Is my mind now quiet because I found AN answer (doesn't matter if it's the right one) or because that's the truth? I don't know. \u2026 \n\n\nIt's just: Since my mind (or my head) is quiet now or let's say since the rumination stopped I cry a lot. I can't imagine being without my BF. I feel so safe inside his arms and being around him makes my life better (if only I could stop my thoughts) \u2013 but: Maybe a relationship isn't the right thing for us? I feel like he's my best friend. I'm still wondering if I'm asexual because kissing doesn't do anything for me, I can live without it, I don't really know what sexual attraction is and everything about that sexual stuff is so weird to me. I still don't know what being in love feels like, it's like I\u2018m constantly searching for any kind of feelings and because of all this stress and anxiety I feel nothing or now I'm crying the whole time. It's so exhausting. I can't break up with him. I can't. I need him. When I imagine breaking up with him I'm crying again. I just feel so trapped. I feel like I can't be with or without him due to mental problems. Or maybe because it's just not right. I fear that if I break up with him I'll regret it a few weeks later and realize it was the wrong decision and then we can't go back. \n\n\nLife's so horrible.

It's both our first relationship, so we're really inexperienced. I'm a very shy and also very anxious person. I have a lot of problems with myself. I know that I should undergo therapy but I don't have the time for that at the moment because I'm really stressed out... I need to study and don't really have time for my relationship\u2026 But maybe it's also just avoidance behaviour?\n\nIt took us over a year to get together, it's a very long story because we're both really shy and awkward, so it wasn't easy, but I always felt like there was something in the air. I was just too afraid to make a move, in the end he did. Since we're together\u2026 I constantly have doubts. I don't feel in love. At least not like I always imagined it. I thought being in love means you're smiling all the time, you can't stop thinking about them, you want to spend every minute with them\u2026 and all this \u201ebutterfly stuff\u201c. But no, I don't have that. Neither does he, as far as I know. We've talked about that and that helped my anxiety\u2026 but well\u2026 it really tears me apart. \n\nI care about him a lot. I want him to be happy, I just sometimes think he could be happier with another woman instead of me\u2026 and if that's the harsh truth I guess it would be okay. I have a lot of self-esteem issues\u2026 When I lie alone in bed at night I miss him and wish he would be there. Often throughout the day of course I miss him\u2026 or I see something that I wish I could share with him. He's often the first person I wanna tell good (or bad) news to. I'm also constantly wondering what he's doing and if he's alright. I absolutely love his voice, I have recordings of his voice that I listen to before I go to bed alone. He has an amazing personality that I'm really fascinated by, his parents really raised him well. I could listen to him for hours even when he's talking about stuff I don't understand (like his job), it amuses me and I love how passionate he is about it. I feel comfortable around him (as long as my thoughts/my anxiety doesn't get me down). I even had a moment where I was thinking about what could be engraved in our wedding ring and that I'd like to have his surname.... \n\nI know it sounds great\u2026 BUT\u2026 when we kiss it doesn't really turn me on or at least I'm not noticing it. It's not bad but either \u2026 it's not overwhelming\u2026 like I always imagined it? I once was a bit drunk and then it felt different\u2026 or we tried to change our kissing style (we've never kissed other people before) and then the first time we tried \u201eheavy french kissing\u201c it was also different, I was thinking \u201eokaaay\u2026 that was interesting\u201c and was grinning. The next few times I was again busy with thinking what we're doing there\u2026. It just really bothers me\u2026 I think it should be different? But I don't know\u2026 Sometimes when he kisses my neck I get shivers down my spine (in a good way), that's interesting. But well\u2026 :( I don't know. I kinda feel drawn to him just this \u201esexual stuff\u201c isn't really something for me? I'm wondering if I'm asexual and talked to my best friend about it but she says she thinks my problem is maybe more the fact that I'm such a reflective (?) person and can't let myself go\u2026 but she's not sure. I spend a lot of time thinking\u2026 :( It's weird. *I could write more about myself and the kind of person I am to explain it any further but I don\u2018t want this post to be too long.* \n\nThe thought of him not being a part of my life makes me desperate.

I remember hiding myself in the bathroom to \u201efeel safe\u201c because that was the only room in my parents' house with a key to lock the door. I remember sitting there on the floor and crying a lot, envying my friends for their parents. I haven't experienced any hugs or stuff like that from my parents and of course I wouldn't let these people do that, let them get close to me in that way...

I don't know if it's because I'm asexual (never thought about that) or because I'm scared of having sex, so maybe it's there but I don't feel it or smother it. I don't know... \n\nI'm afraid I might lose my bf (we're together for nearly one month, but I've known him for years and there was always something in the air, but we never talked about it) because I'm wondering if we're better off as friends cuz I don't have any of the typical \"in love signs\" which makes me scared. :( \n\nI'm afraid in the end I might lose him completely because he isn't \"open\" for a friendship and never wants to see me again. I'd definitely understand that, but it would break my heart.

But the fact that I felt nothing or at least no happy feeling, no spark, no butterflies, whatever makes me desperate. Maybe it's not right? So maybe he isn't the right one? Maybe we shouldn't be in a relationship? Maybe we're better off as friends? I don't know. I could cry so much... \n\n\nI guess it's important to say that before we got together I had some sexual dreams with him and I often imagined what being in a relationship with him would feel/be like. There was also sometimes some sort of tension in the air and I wished I could be near him, but I kept him at distance because I didn't know what he felt. That was a difficult time. But now... it's like it's all gone. \n\n\nAnother thought that came to my mind was that maybe I'm asexual? Because I never looked at a man and thought \u201eI want to have sex with you!\u201c or something like that. I don't feel any sort of attraction to people. Or maybe I just don't recognize it. \n\n\nMaybe it's also a psychological problem because the way my parents raised me was very \u2026 well let's say it wasn't nice. Especially mother liked slapping me in my face. That's why I'm a very unapproachable woman, I keep people at a distance, I'm not used to hugs and human proximity. \n\nWhat should I do? I feel devastated. :( \n\n\n**TLDR: When I kiss my bf I feel nothing, wondering if something's wrong with me or our relationship (better off as friends?) and/or I'm asexual :(** ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (24F) am having my first relationship and kinda feel nothing while kissing, wondering if I'm asexual", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7or2w4/i_24f_am_having_my_first_relationship_and_kinda/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Kimoly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514420307, "domain": "self.relationships", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mize5/he_23m_likes_me_24f_though_im_overweight_and_i/", "id": "7mize5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "m-io personal", "link_flair_text": "Personal issues", "locked": false, "num_comments": 46, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/7mize5/he_23m_likes_me_24f_though_im_overweight_and_i/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1514487185, "score": 18, "selftext": "We are together now for three weeks.

Since then so over the last 2 years I have found some friends which I'm really really grateful for. The problem is: I don't wanna leave them behind.

Over the years I heard from many people that they think I have social anxiety, that my behaviour isn't just shyness, that I should do a therapy. I don't know. \u2026 This just leads to the fact that until now I've never had a relationship, I never kissed a guy, nothing. \u2026 You know hugs are the highlights of my life, which I think is really sad. \u2026 I once read: \u201ePeople who don't know where to put their arms while hugging because they're not used to it.\u201c Describes it best. All this social stuff is really complicated for me, I feel like over the years all the people around me just figured it out how this all works, like they went to a class where they learned all about it and I just missed it. I really don't see that things will change...\n\nSo much for the introduction. The point is the following:\nWhat really bothers me most atm is that there's this guy. He's a few years younger than me and we're sort of the same, he's just not THAT \u2026 \u201emiserable\u201c when it comes to social interaction. I think I have way more problems with all of that. But he understands it. He knows what it's like. Besides that we also have a lot in common. The problem is: Many people tell me that he \u201ewants something\u201c from me, that he's into me. And well.. I don't know what to think anymore. I told them for months that they're not right, that I don't believe that, why would he? They tell me I'm blind, that it's very obivous... and that we would make a great couple... Though some of them are also unsure, they don't wanna talk me into believing something. And yeah. I don't know. It just drives me crazy, it tears me apart. I absolutely can't ask him about that. :( I'm too shy, I'm afraid that it would ruin everything, our.. friendship, when I ask him and he \u201ejust\u201c sees me as a friend. Which is fine you know, I haven't had many male friends in my life until now and I'm really glad he's there. The risk is just too high. I'm afraid that I am right and after asking him, he leaves and well, that was that. I'm alone. I don't live here for too long and he's one of the few people I know (to be honest nearly the only one) but the most important one. And honestly: If my friends are right and he's into me, that might be even a bigger problem. I can't even look people in the eye when I talk to them so how should I \u2026 kiss somebody? Gosh, even thinking about such situations makes me blush.\n\nSo... What would you do? And in general: **Do you notice when somebody is into you?** Do you believe it? Do you ignore it because you know you can't handle it? Or the other way round: **How do you act when you're into somebody?** Too afraid to tell them? Do you missed many chances in life because you're so incapable? I really don't know what to do...\n\n**tl;dr**: People tell me he's interested in me, I'm not sure and don't know what to do because I'm afraid it might ruin everything. Just feel miserable. \n\nThanks!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "How do I (25F) know if he (23M) is interested in me?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6nb5tj/how_do_i_25f_know_if_he_23m_is_interested_in_me/", "view_count": null}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Kimoly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1498592634, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6jv7hu/things_i_liked_doing_feel_like_work_is_that_a/", "id": "6jv7hu", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/6jv7hu/things_i_liked_doing_feel_like_work_is_that_a/", "retrieved_on": 1500188015, "score": 2, "selftext": "I posted this somewhere else but maybe it belongs here. I just wanted to ask you if you think that this is a sign or the beginning of depression? If you've ever felt like that and maybe if you have found a solution. I have to say that until now I've never talked to a psychologist or a psychiatrist though many people tell me that I should do a therapy (not because of depression but because I have other problems..) - Thank you! \n\n**Here's the original post**: \n\"I'm not quite sure if this is the right place to post this but well... I also don't really know if I can explain it correctly so that someone can understand it. I just wanted to talk about it because it really bothers me atm. I just feel like a lot of stuff that I once liked to do or that I normally like to do feels like work. In some case. For expample: When I was younger I read a lot. I'm part of this Harry Potter Generation and I remember when a new HP book came out, I bought it immediately and completely lost myself in it for days. I couldn't stop reading until I finished it. Nowadays... I still buy a lot of boks and maybe that could be part of the problem. I have 3 piles of books next to my bed, I \u201eread\u201c about 5 books at the moment, but \u2026 I'm just not able to sit down and really focus on this one book. Maybe I'm able to read about 10 pages and that's really a success for me, then I put the book down. My mind just wanders somewhere else while reading... and then I look at all the books around me and think \u201eWhen the hell shall I be able to read all of this?\u201c I have a wishlist of ~500books on amazon. I guess I might need 3 lives to read all of this. And then I get sad because I know this isn't gonna happen. There's one book that I guess I really like but I started reading it nearly about 2 years ago and still haven't finished it! Same thing with movies or series. I have a pile of movies at home but everytime I look at it it's like \u201eMan, that are a lot of movies... when should I watch all of them?\u201c What happens then is that I don't watch any of it and they just lie there. Or when I try to do it takes a lot of time... why? A big part of my problem is my concentration. When I do something it doesn't take much time that I lose interest in it or that my thoughts go somewhere else. Of couse then I don't notice what's happening on the screen and I have to rewind or to stop the tv for a moment. This leads to the fact that sometimes a movie that is about 2 hours long can take me 4 hours to watch it. Madness. I know. :( And don't talk to me about Netflix. My list there is soooo long.... another thing that makes me sad. I once made a list (something I really like to do, making lists for everything) for the average length of an episode of a series on my netflix list. Just to see if there are any shows that I'm maybe able to watch. Of course if an average episode lasts about 1 hour it makes me desperate again. Then I guess that I won't watch that show. Maybe if an episode is 20-30min long I'm able to see it, to \u201eachieve\u201c something. To get it off my list. I guess then it doesn't feel like I watch this series for fun or because I'm interested in it but rather because I wanna finish it, you know? To get it off my list. It just makes me sad and desperate and well ... I don't feel like doing anything because I know that I'm \"not able\" to do it. To read a book, to watch a movie or other stuff that I once liked doing. I guess I could go on but this post is already long enough and I'm not sure if anybody will read it. Does anybody know what I'm talking about? Have you ever felt like that? Is this psychological? Any advice?
