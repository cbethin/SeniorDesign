But this is a LOOP. A dead end paradox.\n\nMen don't fuck men they fuck women. Someone's daughter.

The feminist propaganda.\n\nWe should teach our kids to slut shame men too.\n\nReally we need it. Detterance in an environment is not SUPPRESSION. It's a modified environment.

Recently diagnosed with major depression and on meds and therapy. \n\nSo this happened last week. I never actually do hard drugs.\n\nI was abusing weed over a year. I stopped smoking weed 3 months ago, soon after I realized that regular weed is nothing but suppression. So it doesn't clear your mind at all. Because when I quit, first weed I had huge panic attacks (it was a very tough time for me quiting weed didn't help lol). About 3 weeks later I had my biggest ever mood swing.\n\nI had jealous issues with my gf and her past (which is not that active tho) made me go crazy... She dumped me 2 months ago... I realized too much about my self how my character is. I just didn't know how could I ever change my self. \n\nSo I'm on a very new antidepressant over 3 months and on going therapy.. \n\n\nLast week I tried coc for about 4-5 hours. Still don't get its high I'm newbie. \n\nWhatever a friend I met that day have me a pill. Ecstasy (amp) \n\n\nShpooooot kaboom what...? \n\nMan. I'm cured... My ego? What... All the stuff I used to read made whole lotta sense (lao tzu etc).. \n\nMan I met my self. My authentic self. I was 2 people \n\n1 is the character you are which is a shell that was built when you were a kid. So your family and elementary school environment kinda shapes it. I was physically abused for about 5 years in elementary school by my teacher. \n\nI was very suicidal when my gf left me 2 months ago... \n\nNow... Man life is SO SIMPLE. \n\naccept your true self, love it embrace it and FORGIVE IT. \n\n\nThen you forgive all the poor people who hurt you... You forgive because you know what they don't know why they did it... \n\n\nBut the transformation takes time. \n\nSo this shell with pieces is now habitually replaced one part at a time by my self through therapy and self help. \n\nBecause my habits stay still. When I face rudeness the first first idea pops about is self blame... \n\nSo habits are important. \n\nI thank God for not ODing that night. \n\nBut guess what. I embrace death... As it is. \n\nI feel so relaxed :) \n\nI'm cured. The depression is a mind eluding illness. \n\nI was In this critical thinking self growth path for YEARS but I lacked love. \n\n\nNow I'm love. I met him. My self. Poor thing.. Got broken so many times mostly by my mindless copings... \n\n:) woooow\n\n\nWeed sucks. (regular (abuse)) It only increases your cortisol levels. You don't feel it until you quit. \n\nIt brings anxiety. And you lose euphoria over time... \n\n\nSo this is my experience. I never had such thing in my life. \n\nEverything now got meaning. \n\nI feel full filled... \n\nLet the light lead the way\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nWhen you meet your real self... It is pure love and mercy... \n\nI'm so relieved people. My legs feel orgasm at all times. \n\nI hope you all find yourself. \n\nNow I have zero expectations in life. No worries of future as it is unknown and no grief over past as it's gone... \n\nI'm not changed yet I acknowledge the fact it takes *time* beyond the efforts but it is possible. \n\nTo preserve your new character you need to proactively build your environment... \n\nI recommend the book: will power doesn't work. \n\nWeed is for the weak. Stronger will face themselves. I met myself. I was week because I was afraid and running. No more... I'm strong because I stopped and faced it... \n\n\nI don't want to be boring but doing drugs regularly will harm you in the long run. There is a reason we did what we had to do. Now it's the time to move on. I will be the personal Jesus the drug person who sheds nothing but love and understanding :) in return of more light \n\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Drugs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7l", "subreddit_subscribers": 444815, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I experienced the ego death on X and Coc", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/9dnjps/i_experienced_the_ego_death_on_x_and_coc/", "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "wls": 3}, {"author": "lockedstar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_id": "t2_k7lczg4", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1531476468, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8yiqdg/since_2010_im_like_this/", "id": "8yiqdg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/8yiqdg/since_2010_im_like_this/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1531476469, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I was on drugs for a straight year at the beginning I thought it cured\n\nI was very happy. I can't tell you the feeling of success self control discipline hope and high self estee that I had. While nothing much changed actually.\n\nNow I'm clean for a month for real and 2 weeks practically.\n\nI'm on therapy and some meds.\n\nNever had therapy before.\n\nThere are some things I want tp share with you.\n\nI know how you feel. How lonely, how ruined. How isolated... I remember last year I wasn't able to stand and Chat with people. They always asked me if i was sick. You probably can relate this.\n\nA single small event happens. I go home and cry alone. Ending up in the toilet floor crying and feeling completely lost.\n\nThis can be cured.\n\nSometimes yes, the pain will be unbearable I know. I will have anxiety attacks full of stress so much that you will end up getting sick like I am now.\n\nBut there is a progress.\n\nI know all those people seem so fake to you. I managed to change the way I perceive this.\n\nThey are not fake. To are not role playing. They are people humans. It is just that you are so self conscious that you know where you are in an emotional level and you can't seem to understand and identify where they stand.\n\nAs you heal this will change trust me.\n\nI was very suicidal at the age of 16. 7 and half years passed. Not doing drugs wasn't easy. Trust me.\n\nMy 2 recommendations are:\n\nDon't ever do drugs of any kind. They will take the pain as long as you use it but you will think it's all gone. It took my months to realize it. They won't heal you...\n\nStart a relationship with someone you fancy if you don't feel very insecure about your self. I used to be VERY insecure. Completely believe no girl would ever want me in their life. Yes as an over thinker, I used to care what others have to tell and this really ruins your life.\n\nWhile being high and mellow my self esteem and self confidence was so high that the way I see the world was changed... After some time I felt like a criminal and kinda developed a criminal mindset as a side effect. I was no longer afraid to commit a crime. I didn't commit any but I knew I could fight anyone anywhere. And empathy was quite gone. Etc...\n\nAnd luckily my life was quite fun at the beginning of these druggie times. Trips, sex, always busy doing cool shit... If I had more money and friends like me I was ready to go for the harder drugs that don't sedate but stimulate. If you get what I mean.\n\nI would do shit and did shit that I was too much a pussy before. (no offense to ladies)\n\nAnd I was mellow you know. I never cared what people ever thought of! I was invincible \n\nListening to music on speakers at the campus and anywhere no fucks were given. Some big dick energy...\n\nAnd then I had a relationship. Quit stuff. Now almost everything sucks. I can't tell you the stress you will feel im the first week and the huge mood swing that will put you back in depression in few weeks. It's so sudden you won't understand whats going on! \n\nI had moodswings again etc. \n\nBut now, you know whats changed. \n\nI have someone in my life... Someone who is not like me quite different. I never knew it was that hard to love and being loved.. \n\nBut now I have a reason to start going to gym.. \n\nI have a reason to fight and force my self to change \n\nI have a reason to go to therapy and taking meds\n\nTo stop consuming drugs that would definitely ruin my life to the smallest pieces I know for sure, the apathy it caused, the recklessness and a heart of a stone... Now I have my feelings back. These shits erase your personality. Trust me.... Weed alcohol they are not innocent at all. And trust me they are not helping... \nIf you popped some xannys you know what I mean \n\n\nPlease try to make friends. Socialize. \n\nFind stuff you will like. Like art... \n\nJogging will help you.. \n\nKeep yourself busy.. \n\nI had some critical stuff this year and back in then I might have lost a close family member. Thanks God it didn't happen. \n\nBecause I was not ready. I would collapse and end it. \n\nSo just because you don't have the motives and courage to commit suicide today, it doesn't mean you haven't tomorrow.  But if you find a REASON you will fight for it and you will be ready to face what others are ready to. \n\nBeing on the edge is risky. \n\nYes for the last 8 months the apathy I had well it was intense.. 7 and half years of depression.. I never had experienced what I did in the last 8 months. This urged me to stop but it was not enough. I didn't and still don't, find a reason in my self to fight for it... Sometimes we can't see the light in our hearts... Because its so weakened. Having a close friend or a SO will help you... They will add a meaning to your life. \n\nApathy was worse because, you know the feeling of hopelessness. It's painful. But in apathy you don't feel it, but you know it won't go away for SURE...\n\nI no longer had emotions and joy excitement I had... Thanks to seeking no help and doing drug instead\n\nI suffered physical abuse in childhood. Mental abuse in high school... Those people are not here any more but I know I feel the same. But it's getting better... \n\n\nWhat saved me from suicide back in then was the acts of God (stuff I couldn't control, luck, environmental change etc). I stared doing art as a way of self expression. \n\n\nI wanted to tell this because I believe every being deserves better. Because this is a curable illness... \n\nI wanted to share because even tho I don't know you, I have been there in some sort... \n\nThere are beautiful people who likes to share and help others for NOTHING. They change your life... Trust them. \n\nGod or cosmos (what ever you name it) will send them... \n\nPlease don't do drugs. Open your broken heart to someone who you can trust. \n\n\nStop hating yourself. \n\nI have spent one third of my life like this... Now I have major depression... \nProbably I had it all those years. \n\nI can't even tell those to my family. \n\nAnd if didn't have a family I would end my life dozens of times. But it doesn't matter if you don't have one. Remember that you can build one... \n\n\nNot your fault... \n\nIt was my teacher who beat me up for years in elementary school. It was the sons of assholes who mocked me and mentally abused me all these time. \n\nI was alone, weak and defenseless. \n\n\nYou will be healed... Worry not \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 368945, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Since 2010 I'm like this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8yiqdg/since_2010_im_like_this/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "lockedstar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_id": "t2_k7lczg4", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1531393222, "domain": "self.JordanPeterson", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8y8r1s/questions_to_mr_peterson_on_retrospective/", "id": "8y8r1s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8y8r1s/questions_to_mr_peterson_on_retrospective/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1531393223, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "So Mr. Peterson I ve been following you for a while.\nI feel like an oddball old schooler for having some morald and ideals...\n\nSo my girlfriend and I have been dating for a few months.\n\nWe had an argument about lifestyles and kinda hit the dead end.
