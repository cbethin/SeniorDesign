Classic recipe for disaster. \n\nAt 16 i got type 1 diabetes and at 18 i got kicked out of high school at the start of my last year, at 20 i tried again and failed.\n\nFast forward to growing up and moving out, didnt even talk to my family for the 6 months i lived alone in a 15 square meter box.\n\nThats the history out of the way, imagine a depressed teenager just turned 16 getting diabetes and having to inject yourself and monitor your blood glucose. Did. Not. Work. Out. \n\nAt this point i'm 24 years old, i recently moved back home to my parents because my depression has taken a turn for the worse.\n\nI mentioned my diabetes earlier, and the reason for that is because i lost 31 kg (68 lbs) from 90 to 59 kg. I was underweight at this point and got my first big panic attack, which somehow released a chain reaction of physical and mental instability causing a wide variety of physical symptoms.\n\nI've had severe back pain for months now, random nausea, headaches and pulsating pains appearing in random spots all over my body from time to time, and i feel like i'm chained to my bed, i'm frustrated, i'm sad, i'm angry, and i'm spiraling down a hole feeling worse and worse with each passing day, the last 2 days i've broken down several times crying both in the company of my parents and by myself.\n\nI can deal with the pain, but not having the physical stamina on top of not having any energy mentally, aswell as a back that doesn't allow me to move for more than 30 minutes at a time is a god damn hell.\n\nI've never been so afraid of my own thoughts in my entire life.\n\nTL;DR I have diabetes, chronic pain, im underweight and i have severe depression. fuck.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 407193, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The wombo fuck my life combo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ye25f/the_wombo_fuck_my_life_combo/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "jake1706", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_w4vqz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542484918, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9xzh11/all_time_low/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9xzh11", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9xzh11/all_time_low/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1542484920, "score": 1, "selftext": "I don't know much about depression, but i'm diagnosed with severe depression without having had directly suicidal thoughts. Throughout my life i've always researched anything that has happened to me or my family, always stayed informed and prepared .. But depression genuinely terrifies me, and as a badly managed type 1 diabetic for 7 years thats saying alot.\n\nI was pretty energetic as a child, running and climbing even after everyone else was tired .. People liked to take advantage of that and tease me to the point of me chasing them (I was pretty big and aggressive for my age)\n\nSo yea i was bullied like alot of other people .. Got diagnosed with ADHD when i was 9, kicked out of school, transferred to special ed where i didn't learn to do assignments, barely scraping by until i somehow calmed down and was transferred to a Mensa school where i made a friend for the first time since preschool.\n\nI played video games throughout my entire life to escape reality, and it worked pretty well, now i had a friend that i could play games with.  \n\n\nHigh school ... tried for a total of 6 years now. I never actually learned to do homework and assignments in my special ed school, and did the bare minimum at the Mensa school, I handed in the first couple assignments on time, then handed them in late, then i was embarrassed that i was handing them in late, so i pushed the assignments until i stopped doing them entirely. I've redone 1st and 2nd year 3 times now.\n\nI started doing the subjects 1 at a time which seemed to somehow work, moved out and started doing everyday stuff for everyday people. Except i didn't make enough money, so i was slowly draining my savings and i was isolating myself even more than before. I stopped talking to everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty sure my mom realized because she asked me to move back home .. So i did, and my dad helped me get a job so i could socialize, my parents were supporting me the only way they knew how.\n\nI stressed out, i was definitely not used to being with people every day at this point, which wouldn't usually be a problem, but i got sick. I didn't just get sick, my chest felt like i was getting stabbed. I went to the ER immediately and they said that there was nothing wrong. Not true, i'm underweight from not managing my diabetes for 7 years (used to be 85 kg, now i'm around 60 kg). So i talked to the doctors and they helped me get my diabetes on track, which is now going alot better than before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a little bit, started with chest pain, then chronic back pain, nausea, loss of appetite, massive sleep problems, stomach problems, migraines, the list goes on. I've had, and i currently have alot of different physical symptoms that i don't understand and i've been through so many tests i've almost given up on finding out why im sick. Then my grandfather dies, and i have my first panic attack, which i knew from reading is common with anxiety. I went to the doctor, then a psychologist and so on and so forth, here i am, finally in therapy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut i am really struggling. My back pain isnt getting better with physical therapy, i almost feel chained to my bed, i feel like im stuck in place, with no hope or aspiration, i have no desire to go out of my room, i used to love cooking, now i can barely eat, i've done 6 years of high school with nothing to show for it, i used to have passion projects i would spend 18 hours a day in weekends working on. I have nothing, i don't even like playing video games anymore, i argue with my parents every day, they don't understand depression, i don't do the research to explain it, they don't know how or they don't research it. Don't get me wrong they drive me to therapy, they try to take me grocery shopping to get food i want to eat, they try to talk to me and get me outside the room, they try the only way they know how, and i love them, but i'm starting to feel smothered. Asking me if i've eaten, asking me what my blood sugar is, asking me about everything they say at my appointments and asking me how i'm feeling every day.\n\nI feel horrible every day, tonight i hit a new low, i started having a panic attack and desperately called one of my friends i play video games with (online friend) just to talk and calm down. I'm scared that i'll spiral down further, i'm scared that the darkness is gonna catch up to me .. but most of all im scared that even if i get better, life will pass me by and i'll have nothing to show for it.\n\nIf you've made it through, thanks for reading my vent.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 406638, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "All time low", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9xzh11/all_time_low/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
