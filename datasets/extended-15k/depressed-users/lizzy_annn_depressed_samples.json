I'm absolutely desperate for some relief. Hopefully someone here has an idea of what I should do.\n\nIt's a long story, sorry about this.\n\nLast November I had an allergic reaction. My whole body was covered in hives. Turns out I'm allergic to omega 5 gliadin, a particle of wheat. It only shows up combined with exercise. My doctor suggests I eat gluten (wheat) free.\n\nThere was a waiting list in the hospital of several months. Ever since I had that first allergic reaction, I started reacting to foods I've been eating for years. From my yoghurt breakfast to my evening snacks; I'd get hives. Not so much as the time I had the actual allergic reaction, it was a couple of bumps each time. It freaked me out though, because I didn't know what I was doing wrong and so I got afraid of eating. A colleague told me about an elimination diet where you avoid products that are high in histamine. This helped instantly. I still got hives but a lot less than before.\n\nSo when we finally discovered the omega 5 gliadin allergy I figured the daily hives would dissappear when I started eating gluten free. I'm combining a gluten free with a histamine free diet which is very hard. But unfortunately everything is still the same. I get histamine related migraines and daily hives. My dietician tells me I need to reintroduce histamine rich foods and that histamine intolerance isn't a real thing which makes me feel as if I'm not being taken seriously. Every time I reintroduce something I start showing more hives so I haven't reintroduced anything for a while now. Moreover I've actually started eating less and less, because I've also been having severe GERD issues.\n\nI've had heartburn for over 2 years but ever since November this has become so severe that I can't even sleep anymore. They tested me for h. pylori but it came back negative. I eat as neutral as possible and have taken all possible measures: I've hightened one side of my bed, I take ranitidin two times a day, I chew my food thoroughly, eat small portions etc. But still after each meal I start bulching so badly that it feels as if I'm about to suffocate which freaks me out. It's as if my stomach is rejecting the food without actual vomiting.\n\nFood has almost become an enemy at this point. I eat as less as possible and I'm losing weight. I've been so stressed out these last couple of months that I've been on sick leave from work for a month now with symptoms of a burnout. I started seeing a psychologist and we're starting EMDR therapy next Friday.\n\nOther problems I've been having are:\n- extremely sensitive skin. I can't handle make up or regular soap anymore. Even the most sensitive, soap /perfume free and hypoallergenic facial wash is too much. I get red skin and hives in my face. Been tested but nothing came up except for nickel;\n- weird yellow colored stool sometimes;\n- sun allergy so I barely go outside anymore;\n- hives after exercise without eating gluten, so I'm terrified of an exercise allergy.\n\nRequired info:\n27 years old, 1.67 m, 68 kg, female, medications: Desloratadine and Ranitidin (sometimes Tavegyl), non-smoker for over a year", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskDocs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "subreddit_subscribers": 55703, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Allergy, urticaria and GERD - completely desperate", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8ptil1/allergy_urticaria_and_gerd_completely_desperate/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "lizzy_annn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1524570660, "domain": "self.Petloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/8ejskb/today_my_dearest_tony_died/", "id": "8ejskb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Petloss/comments/8ejskb/today_my_dearest_tony_died/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "REL7q2JM9Vt3oVjOKpnHz6Q8G-0wnj4u-jOXP61Bc4w", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/de7fFzRSfK8vlCRHsdVUSylQoqRO5OeawNCUnOrahVg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=63bd638268b884c65194d0638dfea6f3", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/de7fFzRSfK8vlCRHsdVUSylQoqRO5OeawNCUnOrahVg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=4bd664080157e74d45df47bfd6f580e4", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/de7fFzRSfK8vlCRHsdVUSylQoqRO5OeawNCUnOrahVg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=8015cc7d6d9eca5a6d2d5ce507577c5e", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/de7fFzRSfK8vlCRHsdVUSylQoqRO5OeawNCUnOrahVg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=1c0fe160b2d32f88f0b60f9ee3b49408", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/de7fFzRSfK8vlCRHsdVUSylQoqRO5OeawNCUnOrahVg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=adfb207ab051db884c81a6de505aeee0", "width": 960}, {"height": 1440, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/de7fFzRSfK8vlCRHsdVUSylQoqRO5OeawNCUnOrahVg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=8e83ef96693338f565681298b4a27734", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 4032, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/de7fFzRSfK8vlCRHsdVUSylQoqRO5OeawNCUnOrahVg.jpg?s=ee9f679ad8d7fd85d185d3d2fdbc555d", "width": 3024}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1524573896, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "He was only 5 years old.
