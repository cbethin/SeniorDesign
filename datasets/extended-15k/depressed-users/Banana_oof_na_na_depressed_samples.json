I used to go to weekly therapy sessions and I have been taking antidepressants since I was about eight years old. The only thing is, I feel like I'm lying to myself. That I'm subconsciously acting this way for attention. My parents aren't abusive and they don't neglect me, but I still feel like I need them to give me the spotlight. It's gotten to the point where I've been skipping out on my daily antidepressants to see if I really need them. I've been overreacting to bad situations, being overwhelmed by emotion at the slightest inconvenience. I feel like I'm just weighing everyone down by feeling this way, and I am currently considering suicide just to make people's lives easier. To be honest, the only reason I haven't offed myself yet is because my girlfriend may have depression, and if I die, she may follow in my footsteps.\n\nI know I most likely don't have depression. Most of the time, I'm happy and smiling. Every day I can laugh at a good joke or enjoy a video game with a friend. I'm probably just very pessimistic and emotional.\nI've been tearing myself apart over the past few weeks, emotionally and physically. I need someone to help me, but I'm to scared to ask for it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 398596, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm an impostor.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9qvoos/im_an_impostor/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
