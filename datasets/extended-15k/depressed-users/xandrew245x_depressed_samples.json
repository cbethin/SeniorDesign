This was a big shock to my family, we really didn't expect that. The doctor discussed treatment options and he made it seem like the outlook was fairly optimistic. She underwent treatment and everything went fairly well and it was looking good.\n\nThen a few months went by and she started acting  strange. She couldn't talk or finish a sentence, she couldn't feed herself, or really take care of herself in general. She went back to the doctor and they did some scans and test and confirmed the worst possible outcome, it had spread to her brain. The doctors told us then there wasn't much they could do, but they woukd do radiate on her brain to help shrink the tumor and take pressure off her brain. The radiation helped and she was pretty much back to her old self, but she was much weaker physically.\n\nAt that point my decided that she needed to move her in so someone could help her out, up to that point she was living by herself. The doctor gave her 2 months to live. We have watched her grow weaker and weaker with time, and is  basically shrinking down to nothing. She was relatively okay until about 2 weeks ago when she peed herself and was completely incoherent. They took her to the hospital, they confirmed the cancer spread more, now into her back as well. She can't walk, eat or drink, she just lays in her bed now. She really can't remember who we are, and has trouble hearing and talking to us. This women spend most of her life working as a cna and always cared about everyone else and took care of everyone. She was very independent and always wanted to help with everything even as she grew weaker.\n\nNow She fully relies on everyone else to take care of her and I know she hates it, and it breaks my heart. \n\nMy aunt was like a second mother to me, she had always been in my life, helped raise both my sister and I, and has always been there for us.

I'm on mobile, so sorry in advance for spelling and grammatical errors.\n\nThis takes place around 10 years ago, I was around age 16. My family owns a business, located in a little rural town. Not much happens around here and it is a fairly quiet and safe place. I still live in the town and I often leave my house unlocked during the day and leave our keys in our vehicles.\n\nThe business sat back off the main road pretty far and was pretty secluded and surrounded by trees. Honestly I always felt a little creeped out being there after dark by myself to begin with.\n\nOur office was a modular office trailer, the kind they often rent out to construction sites. When you went into the main door, to the left was a large open room where the office was, straight ahead was the bathroom and to the right there was a storage room.\n\nOne late evening my mom said she has forgotten something in the office and was going to go get it, I volunteered to go grab it for her (like I said, the place at night always gave me a weird feeling, so I didn't want her going alone).\n\nI drive down to the office and pull into our well lit parking lot, it was a cool, clear evening with a moderate breeze. I get out my key, unlock the large deadbolt and opened the heavy door. I flipped on the lights and made a sharp left into the main part of the office. I now had my back to the only exit and to the storage room. \n\nI started looking through her desk for the item she needed, I heard a creeking noise come from behind me, I instantly froze in fear. My combination of being jumpy and the place already giving me the creeps sent my mind into over drive. I tried to rationalize and set my mind at ease. Afterall it was windy out and there were tree limbs that could reach the building on that side.\n\nI finally gained the courage to turn around and peer into the room. The light from the office flooded into the room and I could see to the back wall, and as far as I could tell nothing was there. I chalked it up as the wind, found what I needed and slowly approached the door, my eyes never leaving that doorway to the storage room.\n\nPart of me wanted to look what made the noise, but my instinct was screaming to just let it go. I listened to my instinct, walking out the door backwards with my eyes never breaking contact with the room. I just had such a bad feeling about it  I reached in through the door, flipped off the lights and locked the deadbolt, got in my car and went home. I never bothered telling anyone about it that night, figuring it was just my imagination getting the best of me. \n\nThe next day we found the window for the storage room was broke out and we had actually been robbed. Too this day I truly wonder if whoever robbed us was hiding in that room while I was there, and what would have happened if I would investigated. Worst yet, what would have happened if my mother would have gone there alone.\n\nSo to the would be robber who I almost confronted, let's never meet please.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LetsNotMeet", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t3t8", "subreddit_subscribers": 360250, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Office intruder", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/8rzf8k/office_intruder/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "xandrew245x", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520773455, "domain": "self.smitetraining", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smitetraining/comments/83ml57/almost_level_30_still_pretty_terrible/", "id": "83ml57", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/smitetraining/comments/83ml57/almost_level_30_still_pretty_terrible/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520826479, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "I am level 26 now and have about 75 hours of game time.

I am currently taking classes at my local community College and will take as many classes as I can before transferring.\n\nFirst question is, is it even feasible to pursue a engineering degree while working a full time job? Are there any adult learners who would like to chime in?\n\nI know engineering is a rigorous program to start with, and working on top of it will not be easy, once I get to the point of transfer, I am most likely going to have to switch to a second shift job in order to take my classes during the day, unless my currently employer will work around my schedule. \n\nLooking for any tips or advice. Thanks.

I'm a 26 year old male who is tired of the day to day grind in my dead end job trying to make ends meet. I want to make a change in my life and actually finish school. The only degree that really interests me is engineering.\n\n\n\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I tend to be a very over analytical person, who will scrutinize the smallest details. I've been told that i'm a perfectionist, and honestly if something isn't right, it will bother me. I have worked on a good many projects around my house including designing and installing my own hvac system. My projects usually contain a high degree of planning, designing the layout, estimating materials, doing some CAD drawings to get a good 3-D look at what i'm going to be making. Overall I love to see my projects come together from start to finish. I think i'm a pretty intuitive person, and pretty decent at problem solving. Growing up I often played with lincoln logs, kinex and erector sets, I was fascinated with building, and seeing how things worked. For example I built quite a few mechanical projects out of kinexs like a ferris wheel, car, and a crane, all with moving parts. I've taken a couple of classes that involved using CAD software to design, then build projects. These were my favorite classes. I took a class called structural design, one project was to build a bridge out of a set list of materials following a strict set of rules. The goal was for your bridge to hold the most weight. I thought outside the box and designed a bridge that held the most weight out of the whole class.\n\nI know all of those traits would be good for engineering, but I also have a lot of negative traits that make me worry. I tend to be unorganized, well to me, I have a certain way of keeping my items in order, but someone else looking at my cluttered desk would believe I was very unorganized. I do like to work on projects, but I tend to at time get off track or lose interest, or lose my way with a project. I don't feel like i'm a very creative person and would lack the ability to really come up with outside the box solutions to problems. In high school I did bad in most of my classes due to complete lack of interest, I just hated school with a passion. I was a C student in most of my classes. I have been taking classes at my community college and I have a much better gpa now. I think it was more about being immature and just not taking school seriously. I never had much interest in math, but I do like science.\n\nI feel like i'm not even going to be able to get through the classes for engineering due to not being smart enough. I know they are difficult, and I find myself getting discouraged pretty easily. If I did somehow graduate, I feel like I wouldn't make much contribution to my job. When I have a problem, I often go to google to find answer or do research instead of trying to solve the problem on my own. I feel like I am seriously lacking the knack that make an engineer good.\n\nI honestly feel like even if I passed my math classes I would still struggle with math on the job and it would just put me behind everyone else working there. I also feel like I don't fit the normal profile of people who end up being engineers, for example people who tinker with things all the time, or are always wondering or questioning how things work. I don't feel like I have that passion like others do.\n\nOverall I just feel like I would end up being a terrible engineer who would have to rely on google or others to answer questions and get my work done. Do you think i'm being over analytical and to hard on myself? Do you think I actually have the capability of being an engineer? Maybe I just have the wrong idea about engineers and am just discouraging myself from even trying.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that unfortunately I suffer from mental illnesses too including depression, anxiety and adhd. This also concerns me majorly because the depression makes me very unmotivated, the anxiety makes me afraid of everything and over think everything. For example I'm already worried about not being able to find a job or get internships because of my conditions. And obviously the adhd makes it hard to focus and keep on track. \n\nPlease give me your honest opinion.

Growing up, my favorite things to play with were lincoln logs, kinex and erector sets. I loved building all kinds of structures out of my lincoln logs, and I was obsessed with seeing how tall I could build a structure without it falling over, this of course took a little bit of planning and thought, which I was always good at. I also like hands on work, and I feel like civil engineering would give me more hands on work than mechanical would. I also enjoyed kinex, whether building a structure or some kind of machine, I loved doing both. I remember I build a ferris wheel that actually turned, which was absolutely awesome to me. I also remember getting a plastic engine that I assembled all the parts on and all the parts moved like a real engine. I took a class a couple years ago called structural design where we used a good bit of CAD and built projects. One of my favorite projects was to build a bridge only using a limited amount of supplies with a set of rules we had to follow. The goal was to hold the most weight without breaking. I designed and built a bridge that featured a series of arching beams to distribute the weight. My bridge ended up holding the most weight.\n\nSo I do like aspect of both fields, which makes the choice difficult.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EngineeringStudents", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sh0b", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "civil vs mechanical", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7oy7ng/civil_vs_mechanical/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "xandrew245x", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1515071655, "domain": "self.engineering", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/7o2vrr/day_in_the_life_on_an_engineer/", "id": "7o2vrr", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/engineering/comments/7o2vrr/day_in_the_life_on_an_engineer/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1515134339, "score": 2, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "engineering", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Day in the life on an engineer", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/7o2vrr/day_in_the_life_on_an_engineer/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "xandrew245x", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514986439, "domain": "self.EngineeringStudents", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7nunmz/can_i_be_an_engineer/", "id": "7nunmz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7nunmz/can_i_be_an_engineer/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1515036569, "score": 0, "selftext": "Hello everyone.

I would like to start by saying i'm new here, this is going to be a long post, so sorry in advance. i'm 26 and my depression seems to have consumed me at this point. I have bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and adhd. For my whole life I have worked for my families business, I've never had another job. I did leave for about a year with my ex girlfriend and went to college, but dropped out. I don't really feel like college is for me, I have tried two other times to go back to school and both times I quit fairly quickly. When I came back from school I was excited to work here again, but that soon wore off and I was miserable. However I stuck with it and got more involved in the business. Fast forward 6 years until now and I'm absolutely miserable. Every day is a struggle to just come into work and get through the day. I feel like i'm just going through the motions of every day, waiting for it to end so I can go home and get some relief from it all. For a couple months I was having to work 6 days a week, close to 60 hours and it was just killing me here. I don't mind working and i'm definitely not lazy, but this place just seems to be sucking the life out of me. \n\nMostly I feel pretty bad about myself, I feel like I have been handed everything since my parent's owned the business and I never really had to work hard to get where i'm at. I feel like a failure, and I feel like without them I couldn't be successful in life. However I can't see myself working here the rest of my life, if I did I honestly think I would end up dead. I make fairly decent money here, but I work a lot of over time and typically don't get to spend a lot of time with my friends and girlfriend. A typical day during peak season will be at least 10 hours, sometimes even more, Plus having to work on the weekend. I do make good money because of all of the overtime, but its physically and mentally draining me. I pretty much go home in the evenings and just sit in my chair or lay down and i'm usually asleep by 8:30 pm. But that also has to do with how bad my depression is.\n\nSo I really have been putting a lot of thought into changing my life and leaving this all behind, but truthfully there are multiple reasons I don't want to go. One is, I do make fairly decent money, I mean I'm not going to get rich off of it, but I am able to work as much overtime as I want and make a good bit of money. Now I know I said I disliked working so much overtime, but having the opportunity there is very nice. Secondly I have really good health insurance, I can take as much vacation as I want, I get my cellphone paid for and I get gas for my vehicle. Other than that I don't have any other benefits, I don't get life insurance, vision, dental or retirement. So that is kind of a con about working here. Also I feel really bad for wanting to leave, part of me feels like I should just be happy working here, be happy I have a decent job that's really not that difficult and stay here. I feel like my parents would hate me if I left.\n\nThere are reasons I want to leave though. I don't feel like i'm living up to my fullest potential. I feel like I have the ability to do so much more than I do now. Part of the reason I feel depressed is because I feel worthless working here, i'm just doing a menial dead end job. I feel like there is a job out there for me that would keep me entertained, interested and actually challenge me. \n\nThere are only a few things that really interest me. I've always liked engineering, learning how things work, taking apart things and fixing them. I like a challenge, and I like figuring out why something doesn't work. Those kind of things always held my attention and motivated me to work. There are a few jobs that fit that description. Mechanic, electrician, millwright, maintenance techs. There are more, but that is the one's I would be most interested in. So I kind of know what career I think I would be happy in, but I don't know how to get to that point.\n\nAn electrician I would have to do an apprenticeship, which is really difficult to get, plus the first couple years really suck and so does the pay. To be a millwright or maintenance tech. I would probably need a technical degree which means going back to college, and for engineering I would definitely need a degree.  Like I said, I don't think I could even get through my classes. \n\nSorry this was so long, but I really needed to get this out there.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "At a crossroads in my life, depression has reached its peak", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7jitm8/at_a_crossroads_in_my_life_depression_has_reached/", "whitelist_status": "promo_specified"}]}
