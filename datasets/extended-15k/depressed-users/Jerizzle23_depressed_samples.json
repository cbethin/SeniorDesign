I used to never have thoughts of suicide, but now the thoughts creep in even more. I cant actually see myself doing it, but at the same time, maybe a year ago or so, I could say with 1000% certainty I would never even if I thought about it on occasion. But now its turning into like maybe 80% I wouldnt doit. I'm afraid to tell.my dr. Becsuse I dont want to be lectured or have any repercussions to deal.with on top of everything already. \n\nI'm in college and I switched majors, but I was happier with the choice. I'm in an excellerated program and I have met some great people, but I recently had a slip.up and failed my class by 3% and I have to retake the class. (Needed an 83 on the final and I got a 81 lol..). My friends all moved forward, which they were supportive at first, but now they dont evem talk to me. If I reach out I MIGHT get a reply, but that's it. Which it sucks knowing when you're in your worst state you don't have anyone to turn to. \nI have recently broke up with my best friend since middle school, because he isnt supportive either. I helped him through a 5 year long relationship break up where she left him for one of his good buddies. Now that I'm struggling more than ever he isnt even there, I hardly get a text back anymore. \nMy girlfriend has her own struggles and she helps me out a lot, but i feel.like I burden to her at times. \nIn May of this year I was diagnosed with narcolepsy. At first I was indifferent, but after these 6 months it's starting to get to me because there aren't any good treatment options and my insurance wont cover the \"good ones\" HA! I cope with the narcolepsy by doing my own research because I find it fascinating and I also enjoy telling people about it. But no one really gives a sh*t it seems like. They all say ignorant things that I try to explain like no this is why this or that, but I'm kind of getting shunned. \nMy family isnt as supportive with anything either. I think they think they are, but upon explaining to them recently, I got no where. \nMy brother was also diagnosed with narcolepsy this year and I go to him to tell him all the latest research and things I find about it and he doesn't he seem to care. I got accused of being addicted to drugs because I had told him and my mom that people with Narcolepsy are more susceptible to being impulsive, so I gave the same example the study gave when I read it; \"individuals with narcolepsy are more likely to have a substance abuse problem because of the impulsivity\". I was shocked that they would even have the thought. \n\nI recently moved in July to what was supposed to be a cheaper place and i was gonna be able to save money and not struggle as hard, but it has turned into a worse situation. I cant seem to catch a break financially. I dont even look at my bank account anymore, that just sucks any positivity out of me. \nI had recently lost my wallet which had my social security card in it because I had to take it for a photocopy for something and I had inadvertently left it in there. I was sitting there thinking where I could have left it, I called everywhere I had went that day and no luck. I thought to myself, if I've truly lost my wallet and everything else with it I might as well just end it. (That sounds over dramatized reading it now, but I truly dont think I cant take much more. I've just reached that point I guess.) I found it today, thankfully! \n\nI dread being alone, because all these negative thought rush in, I'm sure that's relatable. I dont really know what to do anymore. I tried getting more involved in old friends lives, but that backfired. I'm one of the nicest helpful people I've ever met. I'm the first person in any situation to offer help when I can. But yet it seems like all the negative sh*t happens to me in spite of my trying helpfulness. I used to be a very positive person, but clearly that hasn't stuck around. \n\nIdk if anyone will bother to read this, but it actually felt kinda good to write all this out so atleast theres that.\n\nHope you all have a great day!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 403495, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just trying to make it..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9veq9w/just_trying_to_make_it/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "Jerizzle23", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2beo1k6t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541698705, "domain": "self.pharmacology", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacology/comments/9vc2zf/unsure_if_this_is_the_place/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9vc2zf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/pharmacology/comments/9vc2zf/unsure_if_this_is_the_place/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1541698706, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "pharmacology", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpaq", "subreddit_subscribers": 8813, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Unsure if this is the place", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacology/comments/9vc2zf/unsure_if_this_is_the_place/"}, {"author": "Jerizzle23", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2beo1k6t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541646798, "domain": "self.pestcontrol", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/9v6eeb/fleas/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9v6eeb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/pestcontrol/comments/9v6eeb/fleas/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1541646800, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I've recently moved into this apartment, well it's been since July, but my dog and 2 cats are now infested with fleas. \n\nMy other apartment had treated the shit out of the grass for fleas and ticks since they were supposed to be bad this year, which they were. \nThis new apartment I dont think treated the grass here, but I now am noticing the \"keep pets off grass\" signs everywhere in my complex.

My mom and grandma think I'm making shit up, that literally pisses me off beyond compare. I have struggled with the symptoms of N for 7 years before I was diagnosed and I didnt have anything to go off prior to my diagnosis because I wasnt sure how everyone else was feeling.

With that I can try to explain and sort of vent to my family about it, but like I mentioned before they have become extremely unsupportive. \n\nHas anyone else had to deal with anything like this with their family?
