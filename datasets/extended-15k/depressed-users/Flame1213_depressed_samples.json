I know pretty much all of my friends only live with one parent at a time but there\u2019s a lot of mental illness and nasty tricks being played on each other in this one and I\u2019m the only one of my siblings stuck in the middle of it since my sisters grew up and moved out. \n\nSince my dad got kicked out, he\u2019s the only who really went grocery shopping, so a lot of the food in my house is moldy and expired. My mom doesn\u2019t clean or do anything except work on her computer, so my entire house smells like dog piss because my dogs aren\u2019t really taken out enough. I do all I can but I go to school and work to help pay for bills in all of this chaos. \n\nI was in the hospital around this time last year because of psychosis. I spent a week in the psych ward and 2 months out of school. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since I showed signs of any of the schizo part though, and I\u2019ve had two different therapists. But I do definitely know I have Seasonal Affective Disorder. Something about not getting enough sunlight and the fact that I live in a vacation town where everything shuts down in the winter and nobody can make any money or do anything this time of year really puts me in a bad place mentally.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend since around February, and when we first started dating, I was still dealing with the aftermath of the psychosis and was worried that I was still crazy, or ya know, clinically insane. Like I did a lot of crazy shit and lost a lot of friends after that. He kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me and has really helped boost my confidence these past 8 months.\n\nBut now we\u2019re getting to the off-season, and I\u2019m telling him how I\u2019m starting to lose interest in things and how being in this house that used to hold my now broken family has been keeping me in bed with tears rolling down my cheeks with choked breaths in between sobs. How all of my friends are suddenly \u201ctoo busy\u201d to hang out with me and keep canceling plans, leaving me on read, etc.\n\nHe keeps telling me everyone is getting sad, everyone is like this, that I just need to make myself happy. Here\u2019s the kicker though; every morning when he wakes up he takes a bong rip, and continuously takes them until he goes to sleep. I can\u2019t smoke like that because cannabis obviously isn\u2019t good for those prone to psychosis. \n\nI really just don\u2019t think he understands he\u2019s self-medicating and he\u2019s not really dealing with his problems either. He acts chill and happy but he\u2019s 20 and still living with his dad, working in a restaurant, and literally all he spends his money on is weed, wax pens, dabs, rigs, bongs, you name it. His hobby is literally just being a stoner. And he\u2019s telling me to just magically make myself happy.\n\nI was prescribed Abilify a little while ago because I knew this seasonal depression would show its ugly face sooner or later. I just took my first pill of it a couple hours ago and this shit completely triggered some type of insomnia and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to sleep tonight. If you read this far, thanks for listening. \n\nTL;DR I\u2019m sad, my boyfriend doesn\u2019t understand why, and my new meds aren\u2019t letting me sleep so now I\u2019m just overthinking and suffering ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 398885, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don\u2019t think my boyfriend really understands it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9r6ufz/i_dont_think_my_boyfriend_really_understands_it/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Flame1213", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ket7h", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539957354, "domain": "self.AskReddit", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9pk1bz/couples_of_reddit_that_have_been_dating_around_a/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9pk1bz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9pk1bz/couples_of_reddit_that_have_been_dating_around_a/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539957355, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was just wondering because it\u2019s been almost a year with my SO and I feel like that is one of the biggest turning points in a relationship", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "subreddit_subscribers": 20400337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Couples of reddit that have been dating around a year, what is an example of a time you sacrificed your own comfort for your partner\u2019s happiness?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9pk1bz/couples_of_reddit_that_have_been_dating_around_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Flame1213", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ket7h", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537495019, "domain": "self.BoJackHorseman", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/9hl5nh/meaning_of_the_staircase_s5_e11/", "id": "9hl5nh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/9hl5nh/meaning_of_the_staircase_s5_e11/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537495020, "score": 1, "selftext": "Did anyone else think him walking up the staircase in his drug-dream mean he overdosed?

I didn't realize it at the time, but Sylvia's thought patterns showing through her writing were matching with mine and slowly but surely when it got to part where she didn't wash her hair for three weeks, I knew she was hitting rock bottom.\n\nNow I've always been researching ways to kill myself, just to keep these ideas in the back of my head. I've never once acted on them, for fear of them backfiring(and I've never had the courage to go through with it). When it got to the part where she took the pills, it inspired something inside me. I know it sounds stupid, and I told my therapist about my suicidal thoughts (not about the book).\n\nAnyway, this is going to sound kind of morbid, but I have enough pills to pass out and never wake up again. I had them in my hand, ready to take them, but I couldn't. So I called the national suicide prevention hotline and talked to some lady about it. Then I read about how this book affected some other people who read it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a great book.

I grew up riding horses and to me, and to anyone who's galloped in a field or jumped a fence on these four-legged majestic creatures, they symbolize the freedom of the past before technology came biting at our ankles to keep us all in the herd. \nIt amazes me that the \"ancient\" man, to me symbolizing the grandparents of our generation painted one to symbolize how his life was before parents were able to track their kids with Find my iPhone and that right before Sara went all out rebellious with experimenting with coke, drew one for Trick.\nThe fact that he wouldn't put it on his van, which I know he had for work, symbolizes that he could never go all out public with her because she was underage, which is a big problem with the hook-up generation nowadays.\n\nThe dog started out as a \"vicious\" looking creature, but he was chained up so I think that symbolized how they started up as wolves and now big dogs aren't good in small houses and don't get the sufficient care they need. A lot of people want big dogs as their first but have no idea how much work it is to train certain breeds if they don't do their research first. The dog started out as a blur to Sara, then all she saw when the filter was taken off was a snarling beast who looked like he wanted to attack her, but his tailed was wagging and he was still chained up and behind a fence.\nAfter walking past him every day and seeing that maybe he was just crying out for attention the entire time, she starts to befriend him and feed him treats, just like Sara had to learn that humans have primal instincts to fuck and fight, but she had to learn the hard way that the latter of these instincts can get out of hand fast. \nI also liked the subtle hint with the mug that grandpa eventually had to drink out of when he was dying, knowing that pugs are one of the most unhealthy breeds and he had to drink out of the mug that commercializes how \"cute\" their deformed faces are, just like a first time dog owner has to eventually deal with their dog getting old and dying. \nThere was also one scene with a toy shaped like a dog, which is all Sara got for a pet. As an owner of two chihuahuas, I can say certain toy breeds are probably the easiest type of dog to start out with for people who aren't good at keeping up the maintenance their dog might actually need.\n\nTell me what you guys think about it.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "blackmirror", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v08h", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[S4, Ep2] symbolism with the dog and horse", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7nkji2/s4_ep2_symbolism_with_the_dog_and_horse/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Flame1213", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514861852, "domain": "self.legaladvice", "edited": 1514863472, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7njnm3/help_with_emancipation_maryland/", "id": "7njnm3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/legaladvice/comments/7njnm3/help_with_emancipation_maryland/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1514931890, "score": 15, "selftext": "I'm in a bad living situation with my mom who is a verbally abusive alcoholic and when we get into fights, she threatens to either send me away or leave the family.

The first time I did them was so chill and it felt like it healed my mind in some ways. The second time, I had a problem that I really had to think about in a new perspective, so when I was peaking on them I almost started to cry but part of me felt like it gripped my subconscious by the shoulders and said \"you don't have to cry if you don't want to\" and just like that all the bad feelings were gone.\n\nI'm not really sure what I'm trying to ask, but I really want to try acid again now that I'm a little more experienced with tripping I just want to know if maybe there are any ways to prevent the frustration when it gets a little too intense and your thoughts don't make sense?\n\nTldr; first time I took acid, it was a little too intense and I kept crying out of frustration of not being able to explain my emotions.

When I first saw Shaggydog's head, I thought 'this is it, its all over for Rickon now' but then I got to thinking, what if that wasn't actually Shaggydog? \n\nBut it has to be a direwolf atleast, right? Because it would have to meet the unique large size of a direwolf head. What if the Umbers went and found another certain direwolf known for leading a wolf pack around the North and killing people, killed her, beheaded her, and dyed her black to take the place of a \"dead\" Shaggydog, while the real Shaggydog is hidden with other Umbers plotting to fuck shit up?\n\nYes, I'm suggesting that Arya's beloved lost direwolf, Nymeria, has been killed and beheaded to help Rickon and the Umbers defeat Ramsay. Now part of me really doesnt want to believe this, but it would also be a relief for Rickon. \n\nAnd maybe it wasnt Nymeria, maybe it was just another direwolf roaming the North, what do you guys think? Do you think it would affect Arya in becoming No One?\n\nTL; DR the direwolf head we saw wasnt actually Shaggydog, but Nymeria in the hopes that the Umbers dont want to hurt Rickon, but to help him", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjz2", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[EVERYTHING] All about Shaggydog", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4im4d1/everything_all_about_shaggydog/"}, {"author": "Flame1213", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1455555523, "domain": "self.trees", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/45xey0/smoked_resin_then_watched_futurama_10/", "id": "45xey0", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/trees/comments/45xey0/smoked_resin_then_watched_futurama_10/", "retrieved_on": 1459187992, "score": 5, "selftext": "So my sister is going to California and I'm staying in her apartment watching her dogs for the weekend. \n\nI ran out of bud so I found her bubbler and scraped all the resin off and smoked it.
