I'm a 29 years old male that grew up in a single mother home with 3 siblings and responsibilities always fell on my lap for some reason, despite having a more selfish older brother that just focused on himself and his own life rather than trying to help out all the time in my home, driving my mother to work and back, being around for everyone, etc. \n\nDuring law school i struggled to get through, suffering from major depression, anxiety, and adhd (pretty dependent on meds like adderall to help me through the work). I was dating a beautiful woman during law school that had a bad past with substance abuse and other issues but she was gorgeous and cared for me so we were inseparable. she was a pt medical assistant and i filled out her fafsa had her enroll in school to get a degree online and tried to guide her and take care of her because her family wasnt very supportive of her due to her bad ways in the past which i ignored and shouldnt have. \n\nI was prescribed lexapro for depression and felt like everything got better in my life, but there was a bigger disconnect between law school and myself. my second summer, i interned in the WH in washington dc under president obama and took her with me that summer. It was a struggle to get through financially but i survived through it came back and finished my last year of law school, but my family began to resent me for not being around as much and thought i wasnt myself on the medication. \n\nIn many ways they were right, it blunted my emotions and i lost control of my finances a bit, i felt manipulated when i came off it and had a graduation party with all my old friends who thought i was finally myself again, but thats when i knew it may have helped me graduate or deal with circumstances but it didnt make them better. During my 2nd bar exam sitting she left me despite getting a job on a campaign in florida and was already with another guy. i had a complete nervous breakdown and people didnt know how to help me at the time.\n\nI confided in her and she knew what meds i was taking and she made me feel more guilty about adhd meds that i believe i do need and so i asked for an antidepressant that both helped and hurt me. after dealing with that toxic relationship, i havent been the same since. i needed to see a psych and go on effexor xr &amp; rexulti for my depression and noticed i was going out more, working out more than ever, and  sleeping with women but none of them took me serious enough to settle down and called me crazy. \n\nI knew i needed to lose some weight and one of the antidepressants was causing weight gain so i quit both effexor xr and rexulti lost 35 pounds and met a new woman right after that. we dated briefly and i confided in her about my story and past although i havent passed the bar and dont have a position at the moment but i am getting my executive MBA online while waiting to interview in the spring for an NFL front office scouting position with a west coast nfl team thats across the country for me. \n\nWe had a good few dates, i was finally getting happy again and she kept pushing for something to happen here but havent found a good fit here and if offered the sports job its a dream of mine. we had an argument and things ended, we only had sex once and it wasnt that great lol due to withdrawals from some antidepressants or i need them and dont realize it again.\n\nIm at a point in my life where i dont want my future wife or kids to worry about their dad being on antidepressants although been through alot so fighting to stay off them and be authentic but things havent been easy since. \n\nI apologize for writing so much, but wanted to give my story along with the question so there was more context to it. Have any of you dated or married a guy in a similar situation and if so how did it impact your decision if you wanted a future with them. I think im too open and honest sometimes but wanted some feedback from women out there.

I also lost 45 pounds coming off rexulti and effexor xr but now also lift much less in the gym unless it's just winter and my career circumstances.\n\nWhen I had these emotions blunted before on effexor xr and rexulti, I didnt care as much about anything but it was beneficial for attracting women and working out like a machine every morning. however, currently getting my MBA on scholarship money I live off of and dont have a job lined up until next spring as a scout for a professional sports team, so sitting home at the moment without a current job takes its toll more now than it did. The sports job next spring has been something I wanted for years and im trying to occupy my time until then but cant get a job in the mean time for whatever reason past 6 weeks.\n\nWas I just attracting hot sluts when I blunted my emotions and didnt care? according to my friends that was the case until I came off effexor xr and rexulti which were the 2 antidepressants i was on and now I'm on wellbutrin xl for post-ssri sexual side effects, adderall xr 25 mg for adhd and low dose anti-anxiety alprazolam for withdrawals and severe anxiety. \n\nAfter being off the two antidepressants the past 5 weeks I did have a fling with a quality woman but she was coming out of a 5 year engagement so maybe she had red flags as well. when i slept with with her, it was one of my worst sexual performances compared to before. she bailed cause I'm only getting my mba living off that money at the moment until my sports job next spring and cant get anything here right now and also not sure I should retake the bar exam.\n\nI genuinely believe emotions do make you weak and I truly didnt give AF about anything on those meds before, but maybe coming off them and finding root causes is a better solution which hasnt worked yet. Maybe the practice of law isnt for me and I'm just becoming more aware of my circumstances, but the correlation between not caring/blunted emotions leading to attracting more women and getting more sex seems to be a real thing for whatever reason.\n\nI also do come from a broken single mother home and I'm just trying to figure out if it's better to stay off those old antidepressants and try to fix my life now despite being more anxious, depressed, and not lifting as much (i did lose about 45 pounds though which was only reason I quit them besides some lethargy and wanting new career direction).\n\nI wanted opinions from those of you who have had similar experiences on antidepressants or meds or going through professional schooling to find out maybe it isnt for you.

I've posted here in the past about going through law school, dating my ex gf that was a dime and although she had anxiety issues etc. she was with me until I couldnt financially support her anymore. Used alot of my scholarship and loan money in law school to help me with things being I come from a single mother broken home and everything was placed on my lap as far as driving my mother to work and picking her up etc. until I was finally prescribed lexapro 10 mg for major depression and anxiety, also on adderall xr 25 mg for adhd (couldnt function without it). at first I was irritable but it felt like a life savor,  I went to class didnt care about what people thought but also wasnt as capable of doing the legal academic work.\n\nI moved to DC right after that for my second summer of law school and took my ex gf with me. interned in the WH and didnt feel comfortable or close with many people there except my ex gf so I'd leave work early and just bang her all night and hit the gym. I came back to law school my 3rd year and things went downhill real quick, spent less time in class and became almost a zombie, not securing any jobs in my home city (also hate my home city cause the commuting life blows and rather have a career outside of here in northeast).\n\nShe left me on day of my bar exam and havent passed since. I saw a psych that put me on effexor xr and rexulti took me off of lexapro and I all of a sudden was able to lift the heaviest amount of weight in the gym I ever have but also put on an extra 45 pounds. I slept with decent amount of women during this time but no one stuck around that long so I knew I probably had to get to the root of issues or whatever it was.\n\nhad my appendix removed after it ruptured and my pain tolerance was so high I didnt even realize it ruptured on these meds, had emergency surgery and decided to quit effexor xr and rexulti cold Turkey. I stopped seeing the psych and only now see a new primary doctor that said I was overmedicated and now I'm better on just wellbutrin xl 300 mg with my adderall xr 25 mg, and xanax 1.0 mg for occasional severe panic attacks but more for withdrawals of effexor xr and rexulti which I'm now past 6 weeks.\n\nThe wellbutrin XL was supposed to help with any lingering sexual side effects from old antidepressants called post-ssri sexual sides but I havent lasted as long or gone as strong when I have gotten laid in past few weeks so not sure its helping. \n\nI hate feeling emotions or any possible vulnerable feeling but I thought by coming off some major antidepressants I'd be able to get back to my old ways in earlier 20s of sleeping with more women etc. I'm currently getting my executive MBA and get scholarship money every semester to live off of and also have a potential pending job in the scouting dept for a professional sports team across the country, so I can understand my career instability at 29 being an issue, especially still living home. \n\nAt what point do you know if you're going backwards or not? I was lifting more and more outspoken before on the two antidepressants but also had more weight gain and some lethargy yet women were flocking regardless. I wasnt able to afford a bar prep course until now so that could explain why I failed so many previous times. Without anyone else to talk to to get honest opinions, what do you do in a situation like this? Winter is here and its alot harder to force myself to study for the bar exam again and just wait for my potential sports position next spring. I've had interviews here but none felt like a fit.\n\nThanks for the input in advance, I know I need to focus first on getting my shit together before anything so trying to figure out what the most optimal way to do that is because I'm back and forth every day.

I Entered law school through a conditional program that's ranked around 100 in the U.S. News World Report which I assume is a T3 or not that great although they put out great successful alumni. \n\nMy LSAT was poor and so were my college grades (148, 2.6 GPA), I enjoyed going out a bit too much at my college and didn't need any meds or antidepressants during my time in college before, I was very happy interning for political offices as an undergraduate etc. \n\nI worked for a pretty big law firm coming out of college as a paralegal and billed good work and hours, this led to a conditional acceptance program to a full-time seat which required me to pass two senior level courses with the grade of a B+ over 6 weeks and I passed and gained admission.\n\nMy most unhealthy and miserable year of my life was my 1L year and my doctor had me prescribed so much adderall for adhd to get through my 1L year. I ended up not even making the median out if my class, yet still managed to land a 1L SA position due to my close relationship with the old managing equity partner. Although I was happy to be back at my old law firm my first summer with my own office getting paid decently, i was very miserable trying to meet the higher billable hour quota, struggling to do quality legal work with assisting drafting memos and research etc. and my relationships at the firm were not healthy anymore. I was given a recommendation by the managing equity partner at the end of the summer for billing over the quota and because we were close, but I know it was probably audited and knocked down by clients or at least that's how miserable I felt.\n\nI continued to force myself through law school, battling anxiety, major depression, and couldn't find an area of law that fit me. I landed a huge internship in Washington, D.C. my second summer that actually led me to being on front page website of my law school and scholarship money for my 3L year. My ex gf broke up with me day of my first bar sitting for not proposing before time (she had major issues I ignored because she looked great so it was my fault), and havent passed the bar exam after many attempts.\n\nMost recently, I took a prep course for the first time Themis and noticed an increase to 240 but need a 266. I was on heavy antidepressants everytime I took the bar exam and now I'm finally weaned off them, but struggling to find the motivation to register again for February because i dont know if it's something i truly dont want and if i did manage to pass and was miserable as a 1L SA in Midlaw with decent hours how do I know I wouldn't be more miserable doing same thing after practicing and being barred.\n\nI never got to see the DA or State Prosecution work but the memos research and billable hour structure was draining. I always had a passion for sports and politics which is why I entered law school and noticed many of them had JDs so I went for it. I have a pending offer to move across the country for a professional sports team as a scout but it's just enough to survive on with full benefits, I wont be wealthy by any means I was told during the interview but I can survive on it. I'm very excited about flying out there following the season for the final meeting and signing a contract but I'm not sure what to do unemployed right now at the moment in my current city.\n\nI've applied to a ton of jobs and even went for my Executive MBA that I'm almost finished obtaining to try and cast a wider net, but I've struggled to find alternative careers. One recruiting agency was going to help me obtain a junior aml position but it didnt work out and now I'm waiting to hear back after a final interview for a compliance officer position for a non-profit but if I dont get this position, I'm still unemployed here at the moment.\n\nI'm struggling going back in the bar exam for February a 6th time, not sure if it's the lack of motivation or being burnt out trying so many times and not being as close as I need to be. I graduated in 2016 and started my MBA right after that but only held a 3 week doc review temp job this past summer for JDs without a license and that's been it. \n\nAnyone in a similar situation or wants to provide some guidance, I'd sincerely appreciate it. I stopped looking for so many answers in antidepressants and more at the actual circumstances of my life. Wish you all the best of luck!

I was prescribed adderall through Law school to help me get through the work and ended up coming down with major depression and anxiety until my old primary care doctor prescribed lexapro to go with it. Literally it felt like I was at peace with myself, but extremely irritable feeling like this should have been done years ago, but there were also downsides like my ex gf at that time was toxic and starting blowing through my scholarship and loan money and I didnt feel a thing. I also noticed when I showed up for graduation, i felt so far apart from my peers and according to friends at that time, I wasnt myself and they kept insisting it while I continued to trust my ex gf. I ended up failing the bar twice and she left me moved to another state after 4 years of caring for her. I had a nervous breakdown and was referred to psych.\n\nAt that point, they put me on effexor xr, wellbutrin xl, rexulti all for major depression and only adderall xr for adhd. I was still suffering from severe panic attacks and anxiety to the point I couldnt exercise or leave my house or go on interviews, so I was prescribed low dose of xanax 1.0 mg which solved all those issues. Despite finally breaking out of that dark depression and failing the bar multiple times only seeing small increases in my score, I noticed the last time I finally enrolled in a prep course it was helping me but one of the meds was making me so lethargic I'd just go to bed 5 PM every day and not put the proper studying time in.\n\nI ended up with a ruptured appendix and putting on 50 lbs making me overweight, I knew my lifestyle needed to change and so after having my appendix removed at hospital I decided to quit effexor xr and rexulti cold Turkey while recovering from surgery, it felt like the perfect opportunity. I got through the withdrawals at least I think so 6 weeks later, even starting dating again but it didnt work out because I havent passed the bar and she didnt want to wait for me to get on my feet so my depression got little worse, then the recent bar exam results from July came in and I failed again but had a higher score than ever before. \n\nI thought to myself if I was going to fail the bar exam again I would need to consider taking layers off and so seeing a new primary doctor he believed I was overmedicated before and now just has me on wellbutrin xl, adderall xr, and lose dose of  xanax 1.0mg. So far I also lost 25 pounds which is good but I find myself a bit more neurotic or anxious and obviously more prone to depression. Also I'm not exercising as much as I was on those meds before but I'm also more awake now sleeping past 5 PM and able to study if I need to. My blood pressure fluctuates it can be high then low and I also have vasal vagol episodes of fainting when I'm drinking or out sometimes which I dont recall having on lexapro years ago, but as relieved as I felt on that med at times, I was a zombie without realizing it so I'm hesitant to go back to that.\n\nWellbutrin xl has least amount of sexual sides and can aid weight loss so I am just trying to stay on this, but I do think effexor XR or lexapro offset these negative sides to some extent at least I think so because I was able to walk in a gym with no anxiety clear mind etc. Rexulti was bad all around causing the weight gain etc. so I'd never touch that again. I didnt need as much approval or affirmation from people before despite the side effects of weight gain and sleeping to much, and now I'm either more aware so I'm more emotional but I need to be strong right now if I'm going to continue to improve.\n\nI have samples of trintillex and still have left over effexor xr but I am hesitant to go back on another antidepressant after battling for 6 weeks to finally come off effexor xr and rexulti. I wanted more input from medical professionals that are knowledgeable on antidepressants like these and if they can blunt my academic ability to some extent or if you think I should give a certain med a chance.

I don't expect many people to read all this but wanted to share my battle on here in hopes for some positive input, thank you in advance. My depression anxiety and adhd really made life difficult for me during an already stressful process to go through during law school. I didnt have the college GPA or LSAT score to get in but I entered Law school through a conditional admissions program that required me to get a B+ in two senior level courses. I managed to get in and left my old paralegal job where I was unmedicated but had alot of different stressors living in a single parent home with three siblings and where most of the burden was put on me to drive my mother to work and pick her up all the time.\n\nI was seeing a toxic ex gf all through law school and knew she had a history of substance abuse and anxiety eating disorder issues but she was beautiful and my companion during the process so I tried to be her white knight and save her also tried to build a life for both of us. I managed to get a first year summer associate job at the law firm I worked for before law school but it did not go well at all despite making it through the summer, I was miserable even with the private office and paycheck, couldn't do most of the work partners put on me. \n\nFast forward to the 2nd year and I continued to spiral into deep depression and anxiety, couldnt speak up in class took to much of my ADHD meds because I had to fight through the work and focus, but I always had a passion for politics and ended up getting a WH internship my second summer of law school. first thing I did was think something was terribly wrong with me so I asked my doc for an antidepressant lexapro I read up on thinking I needed it and immediately I felt like I saved my life to some extent although people said I was dumbed down, no longer the same person, and I think it numbed me to the fact I was dating someone extremely toxic that was doing drugs under my nose.\n\nShe wasnt working her part time job anymore so I took her to Washington with me that summer and I immediately noticed starting the job that something was very off with me and I couldnt even speak to coworkers there, didnt participate in social events, and stayed isolated with my toxic ex in our apt that summer. I fortunately made it through the job thanks to my manager that knew something was off with me and guided me through it. \n\nthe entire 3rd year of law school I didnt go to classes spent all my time with my ex and thought things were just working fine, until I noticed I ran out of my loan and scholarship money and was being robbed without feeling a thing assuming due to lexapro. I managed to graduate with my law degree but my first bar exam sitting she cheated on me for not proposing and I had a mental breakdown and never passed the bar exam since (its been 6 times and waiting for another failure next week but may go back in February for 7th time if I can get my stuff together).\n\nI had to see a psych that took me off lexapro 10 mg and put me on effexor xr 75 mg, rexulti 1.0 mg, and wellbutrin xl 300 mg for major depression with adderall xr 25 mg for adhd and xanax 1.0 mg for severe anxiety/panic attacks. I slowly starting coming out of isolation and hanging out with a good childhood friend and another friend that was younger than me and still in law school. \n\nI only had one 3 week doc review job over the summer on these meds and barely was able to work my shifts while I was studying for the July bar exam this past summer. I was also going to sleep at 5pm and sleeping until 2pm the next day, put on 45 pounds, and despite being able to lift heavier in the gym, I was more lethargic and the meds stopped working when I had an insane reaction or panic attack to just smoking a hookah with my friends. on top of that, I had a ruptured appendix that I had no idea about and needed emergency surgery. \n\nI decided this may have been a sign from God somehow that the meds werent working anymore or needed anymore and so during my surgery recovery I quit effexor xr 75 mg and rexulti 1.0 mg completely, fighting through withdrawals and now only being on wellbutrin xl 300 mg, adderall xr 25 mg, and xanax 1.0 mg. I'm seeing a new primary doctor that said I looked dulled out before and was overmedicated now I lost weight and look much better but my suffering has started again because a family friend of my sister who was a great career oriented woman from good family came into my life texting me in the hospital and we hung out immediately after I got out.\n\nthe past 4 weeks with her were amazing, I confided in her about my ex, battle with meds, weaning off them, and trying to repair my life. she said she wasnt running and wanted to be part of it and I was finally finding some happiness again. She works full time and has a great career and i currently have no job but going on more interviews and trying to get in my feet after quitting heavy meds only 4 weeks ago the entire time we spent together. dinners, saw a movie, even met her employees, sisters and their boyfriends at events and they all had positive things to say.\n\nlast week when I didnt get this part time bank job I was supposed to get, she called me and blasted me for having no direction and telling me she cant be dating someone who is unemployed because she has so much more to offer, I was insulted and said it's only been few weeks give me some time here she knew this and she was pretty rude so we had a bad argument. we were supposed to meet each others families last weekend and she said well take step back with that which turned into not seeing me at all anymore the following day and I was embarrassed heartbroken and shared pics of us on social media bragging and complimenting her, her response was no one told me to post pics so I deleted them and havent spoke to her since.\n\nshe was in a previous 5 year relationship and engaged but they called off wedding and it got messy so I'm sure she has insecurities from her past but so do I because of my toxic ex gf. everyone is telling me I'm better off those two major antidepressants but I'm more emotional, feeling more pain, and girls that I use to talk to months ago fully medicated dont even want to talk to me claiming to have boyfriends now etc.\n\nthe benefits of being so medicated was that I didn't care about opinions or if I was putting on weight or what anyone thought but was sleeping too much having adverse reactions and felt I needed to change to grow but I'm feeling enormous pain hence why I posted such a long story here. I'm praying that if I stay like this the right one will come along and God is watching but it's difficult because I havent held a serious relationship in a long time and at 29 turning 30 soon I feel like a hopeless disaster. any words of encouragement at all or from similar experiences, I'd sincerely appreciate it. I'm back to being isolated and dont know which way to go anymore. God bless you thank you for reading this.

Once I got out of the hospital 4 weeks ago I took a quality woman out that has a career and confided in her about my messy past with ex gf coming off meds and how things were now going to come together. She also came out of a 5 year relationship in which she was engaged to a guy that never worked and recently became a cop so she also felt like she supported him like I supported my ex gf.\n\nPast 4 weeks recovering and only being on wellbutrin xl xanax and adderall xr, I felt more emotions and authentic, getting closer to this girl all weekend hanging out past 4 weeks and going on interviews. i moved back home until I'm on my feet but I have privacy being I come from a single parent home and my mother is always working but I cant move until I repair my life. she understood and I told her to run but she said she wasnt going anywhere.\n\nafter our 5th date she came over and we were pretty hammered off wine but she blew me and we screwed although it wasnt my best performance (im either better on more meds or need to regain better natural stamina coming back to myself). we both got off and laughed about it and then she invited me to go meet her sisters their boyfriends and to be a guest at her company sports event. every one of them from her company to her sister to her sisters boyfriends said great things about me and topd her family I was a great guy. she was feeling me but out of no where said we couldn't be serious until I started working again despite her knowing it's only been 4 weeks since quitting major meds I was on for past 2 years. I deleted a pic of me and her on my Instagram and she snapped cried little bit and said that was immature but she was stating the truth and I told her I'll be on my feet soon but if were not serious I'm not advertising her anymore on social media. she wanted me to upload the pic again so i did and we went home very happy with each other. I even picked her up from a bus stop when she got on wrong bus and bought her a gift when she asked for it immediately thinking maybe it was better to be more romantic as I'm in my later 20s and last relationship I was an emotionless monster on lexapro with my dime ex.\n\nlast week, she calls me Thursday when i find out i wasnt getting some part time bank job although interviewed for bigger position on Friday and tells me i have no sense of direction, discredits any past accomplishments like working in the WH second summer of law school or working for large law firm as a summer associate my first law school summer so I told her I thought she understood I was waking up out of a medicated coma and I'll have a new job here soon as I'm repairing my life, she continued ripping me so I lost it and took a shot at her back because she claimed she was a doctor (shes a physical therapist and my brother and father who I dont speak to are medical doctors) and i told her she wasnt she was a physical therapist she told me I was a doctor too I said no I'm a lawyer got doctoral degree in law but that's not a doctor so relax. I was insulted she seemed to have been surprised I fought back but we calmed down and agreed to take a step back before meeting families. she told me she still wanted to hang out and see me and talk just no family meetings yet till I'm working which I agreed with.\n\ngoing into interview Friday she was wishing me luck asking me how it went and I told her it went very well but then silence the entire weekend last week. I reached out that Sunday and told her maybe we should have made plans and invited her to my family event Sunday if she still wanted to come and she just said enjoy your day with the family so I asked for clarity being things seemed off, she said we arent on same page etc. I told her I was in process of getting it together and thought she understood that but she said she wasnt ready to move forward so I wished her luck and said I wish I didnt confide in her so much.\n\nmy friends and family were surprised as the past 4 weeks since I got out of hospital and quit those two big antidepressants me and her were inseparable but this came out of no where and I'm assuming it was the fight. \n\nDespite family and friends telling me that I'm doing better now and lost weight since coming off two antidepressants, I think my vulnerability and emotions are either hurting me or I'm still healing from what I went through past two years. waiting to land a job and after being put down like that, its only making me question myself more if I should go back or keep fighting forward.  If you're going to be negative or tear into me for acting like a beta, try putting yourself in my shoes coming from a broken home, getting my law degree and MBA despite the disaster with meds and having no guidance or anyone around to help you out.

She also came out of a 5 year relationship in which she was engaged to a guy that never worked and recently became a cop so she also felt like she supported him like I supported my ex gf.\n\nPast 4 weeks recovering and only being on wellbutrin xl xanax and adderall xr, I felt more emotions and authentic, getting closer to this girl all weekend hanging out past 4 weeks and going on interviews. i moved back home until I'm on my feet but I have privacy being I come from a single parent home and my mother is always working but I cant move until I repair my life. she understood and I told her to run but she said she wasnt going anywhere.\n\nafter our 5th date she came over and we were pretty hammered off wine but she blew me and we screwed although it wasnt my best performance (im either better on more meds or need to regain better natural stamina coming back to myself). we both got off and laughed about it and then she invited me to go meet her sisters their boyfriends and to be a guest at her company sports event. every one of them from her company to her sister to her sisters boyfriends said great things about me and topd her family I was a great guy. she was feeling me but out of no where said we couldn't be serious until I started working again despite her knowing it's only been 4 weeks since quitting major meds I was on for past 2 years. I deleted a pic of me and her on my Instagram and she snapped cried little bit and said that was immature but she was stating the truth and I told her I'll be on my feet soon but if were not serious I'm not advertising her anymore on social media. she wanted me to upload the pic again so i did and we went home very happy with each other. I even picked her up from a bus stop when she got on wrong bus and bought her a gift when she asked for it immediately thinking maybe it was better to be more romantic as I'm in my later 20s and last relationship I was an emotionless monster on lexapro with my dime ex.\n\nlast week, she calls me Thursday when i find out i wasnt getting some part time bank job although interviewed for bigger position on Friday and tells me i have no sense of direction, discredits any past accomplishments like working in the WH second summer of law school or working for large law firm as a summer associate my first law school summer so I told her I thought she understood I was waking up out of a medicated coma and I'll have a new job here soon as I'm repairing my life, she continued ripping me so I lost it and took a shot at her back because she claimed she was a doctor (shes a physical therapist and my brother and father who I dont speak to are medical doctors) and i told her she wasnt she was a physical therapist she told me I was a doctor too I said no I'm a lawyer got doctoral degree in law but that's not a doctor so relax. I was insulted she seemed to have been surprised I fought back but we calmed down and agreed to take a step back before meeting families. she told me she still wanted to hang out and see me and talk just no family meetings yet till I'm working which I agreed with.\n\ngoing into interview Friday she was wishing me luck asking me how it went and I told her it went very well but then silence the entire weekend last week. I reached out that Sunday and told her maybe we should have made plans and invited her to my family event Sunday if she still wanted to come and she just said enjoy your day with the family so I asked for clarity being things seemed off, she said we arent on same page etc. I told her I was in process of getting it together and thought she understood that but she said she wasnt ready to move forward so I wished her luck and said I wish I didnt confide in her so much.\n\nmy friends and family were surprised as the past 4 weeks since I got out of hospital and quit those two big antidepressants me and her were inseparable but this came out of no where and I'm assuming it was the fight. \n\nDespite family and friends telling me that I'm doing better now and lost weight since coming off two antidepressants, I think my vulnerability and emotions are either hurting me or I'm still healing from what I went through past two years. waiting to land a job and after being put down like that, its only making me question myself more if I should go back or keep fighting forward.  If you're going to be negative or tear into me for acting like a beta, try putting yourself in my shoes coming from a broken home, getting my law degree and MBA despite the disaster with meds and having no guidance or anyone around to help you out. I sincerely appreciate the input ahead of time and not sure what direction is the right one anymore.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "asktrp", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y2sm", "subreddit_subscribers": 47873, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Battling major depression and anxiety since law school, losing my sense of identity", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/9p0d2x/battling_major_depression_and_anxiety_since_law/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "patriotlawyer00", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ild5jmg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539708838, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9opgs7/battling_mental_illness_for_years_which_only/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9opgs7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9opgs7/battling_mental_illness_for_years_which_only/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1539708840, "score": 1, "selftext": "Long-story short, I grew up in a broken home (my mom is a single mother and I have 3 siblings) and we've struggled financially our entire lives since my father left years ago.\n\nI battled major depression, anxiety, and ADHD throughout law school to get through the work and finally graduate in 2016. I held decent internships throughout my summer one being a summer associate at a large law firm (I was in over my head and wasn't invited back) and the second summer I interned in the WH doing communications which I was much happier doing.\n\nI've seen multiple psychiatrist, psychologist, and primary care doctors all of which put me on different medications and impacted me in different ways. When I graduated law school, my gf of 4 years that I took care of during law school and sacrificed ton of scholarship money/loans for, cheated on me the day of my first bar exam sitting and I had a nervous breakdown, haven't passed the exam since. A psychiatrist had me on too many medications the past 2 years for major depression and possible mood disorders but when I became too lethargic to stay wake past 5pm and apply to jobs, I knew something was wrong. I still couldn't find work and get on my feet, put on 50 lbs and needed surgery to remove my appendix so I recently quit the meds she had me on and changed my primary care doctor to someone who felt I was on too many medications and wasn't even ADHD or had a mood disorder. I recently have been off two of the major antidepressants for 4 weeks now and only take 3 medications, 1 for depression, 1 for anxiety, and 1 for ADHD. \n\nPeople see a tremendous difference in me as I lost weight, seem to articulate myself better now, have more confidence despite suffering from anxiety and depression, and also now I'm applying and interviewing for more jobs and staying up later than I was.\n\nWhile weaning off the meds, I started dating this girl who has a great career and a huge change from my ex-gf and I felt vulnerable and confided in her about my messy past and quitting meds etc. She went from being so into me, to turning on me in a second this past week, putting me down for not working right now and having no direction after or during law school. I was pretty crushed she turned on me so fast and originally said she was going to be with me while I put my life back together, but I guess it's the story of my life. At first it was let's just take a step back and not meet each others families yet to all of a sudden saying we weren't on the same page, I'm a great guy and best of luck. I accepted it and haven't texted her since, just focusing on bettering myself still at the moment. When I was on Lexapro, Effexor XR, or Rexulti for depression I lost my sense of self and emotional capacity, I would chase women like a dog but none of them wanted to stick around and I thought by weaning off them and accepting would lead to some personal growth and maybe the next one would stick around. She certainly did longer than anyone else in recent time but still not sure if there is work left to be done because the meds I still take seem crucial to my mental stability (wellbutrin xl 300, adderall xr 25 mg, and xanax 1.0 mg). My new primary care doctor told me when I was also on the old 3 antidepressants with these, I looked overmedicated, dulled out, and now I look much more present and clear if that makes any sense. That's what I'm holding onto and maybe soon I'll be able to wean off more but at the moment it seems impossible given my horrible circumstances and abusive past.\n\nAs tempting as it is to go back on the old other antidepressants, I made it this far weaning off two of them and I'm noticing more action with interviews (not sure if I'm going to get any of the jobs but at least I'm putting myself out there). Just wanted to vent to get the pain off my chest, as I seem to be the only one that has no stability in my house all of a sudden after thinking I had it together on old medication I was on during law school.

My new primary care doctor thought it was overkill and it is time to take away some of the meds so I recently had my appendix removed after it ruptured and decided to quit effexor xr 75 mg and rexulti 1.0 mg during my time in hospital and ever since the past 5 weeks. I lost the weight gain rexulti put on but I am questioning myself way more than I did in the past and feel more anxious.\n\nMy new primary care doctor agreed to take over my care with wellbutrin XL 300 mg adderall xr 25 mg and xanax 0.5 mg but wanted me to also begin weaning off xanax 0.5 mg and so today is the first time I only took 1 xanax dose and I lost that motivation to get in the gym every morning and I'm even too anxious to go in some ways. ever since I quit effexor xr 75 mg and rexulti 1.0 mg I started seeing a new girl after I got out of hospital past 5 weeks but shes still waiting for me to get a job and get back on my feet. the problem is I'm becoming fearful that I may have taken a step back in some ways despite my family telling me I'm better along with my new primary care doctor.\n\nIf I was better, why do I see people I've known for years start blocking me on Instagram when I started posting pics of me with my new girl and why does it even bother me when before I didnt care at all? I do believe the more manly I act the more uncomfortable my older brother or family becomes for some reason so I'm not sure if they prefer me to be weaker for their own benefit (live in a single mother home) but I at least think since my mother still supports me financially she would want me in best position possible along with new primary care doctor. on the other antidepressants and full xanax dose I'd go to gym every morning do my workout and didnt have emotional capacity I do now but it was beneficial a little except for sleeping at 5pm and not getting a job like that.\n\nIf you found yourself in this position or in a similar position, how do you determine what the best version of you truly is?

The only reason we lost to the Buffalo Bills as bad as we did was because of those fumbles by Cousins within our own territory and we weren't able to play catch-up in time. I truly believe the gameplan for that game was to control the game with the run (which we haven't been able to do due to poor OL and a less than 100% Dalvin Cook). On the bright side, our offense played lights out against the Rams and were in it to win it had it not been for that fumble by Cousins, again ball security and presence in the pocket is what he needs to work on.\n\n2) Most of all our poor secondary and defense has been our weakness this season. Goff played the game of his life against us, let alone Josh Allen who was just shut out by the Packers. Barr should not be in pass coverage and Zimmer should put him back to what he does best in blitz packages being we are without our top pass rusher Griffen, although Hunter has been great. \n\n- After this Eagles game in Philly, the Vikings head into a favorable stretch (I know that's hard to even say after losing to the Bills at home), but if this team fixes these two major issues above and it shows early on in the game against Philly on Sunday, I think things will turn around quickly. I don't want to see the Vikings come away with a lucky win, I want to see these two things above fixed so we actually have a chance this season.

I noticed I seem to be developing a dependency on this anti-inflammatory medication for some odd reason it helps lessen the withdrawal symptoms from antidepressants or has another positive impact on my mental state but not sure why as this was only supposed to last few days after surgery.\n\nIt's been 8 days post-surgery and today is the hardest day I am having yet with trying not to go back on Effexor XR or rexulti and I'm trying to stay strong and stay off it. My new primary saw me yesterday and said I look and sound so much better off of those meds now and don't seem dulled out and as overweight, but not sure if there is anything else I can take to help manage this lucid vivid dreams I'm having and depression after being able to go over a week off those antidepressants. I know wellbutrin xl is also used for depression so I am remaining on that at the moment with the other two meds, but my toradol is running out and when I missed a dose today, I can feel the weight of the depression getting larger.\n\nThank you in advance for your help. (29/Male/NYC/5\"9/now weigh 231 pounds from 243 in just a week and half after stopping effexor xr and rexulti)\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskDocs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xtuc", "subreddit_subscribers": 68465, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Quit antidepressants the same time I had surgery last week, having trouble finding relief mentally", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/9gvxkt/quit_antidepressants_the_same_time_i_had_surgery/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "patriotlawyer00", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ild5jmg", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1536497984, "domain": "self.CoinBase", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/9ecs1b/purchased_btc_on_coinbase_app_today_and_it_says/", "id": "9ecs1b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/CoinBase/comments/9ecs1b/purchased_btc_on_coinbase_app_today_and_it_says/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1536497985, "score": 1, "selftext": "I needed the BTC by today and I thought it was instant?

I'm not sure if I should still fight to see her with my 12 panel results showing it's negative being she's had me stable for awhile or go to my new primary and see if he's willing to prescribe me the same meds that she was but he may be hesitant due to her cutting me off for these errors? \n\nI'm a lawyer getting my MBA and trying to get some career stability after working some temp jobs and trying to pass the bar, the last thing I need is these lab errors causing me to cease treatment that has kept me going for over a year.

After she unfollowed me she looked at my story post was out at a rooftop bar in city with friends and why would she still look if she isn't even following me anymore? Just to make it more odd, she followed my good friend back that she sees in pics on my IG and he unfollowed her cause he thinks she's playing with my head again and I need to focus and pass this bar exam already.\n\nI've only dated a few girls in between this process and none of them have made me want to settle down again probably because of my current circumstance trying to find career stability at independence at 29 (not getting any younger).

Lithium and lamictal didn't work but she added Wellbutrin XL 300 mg with Rexulti 1.0 mg and the combo seems to have stabilized the fire in my brain for the time being. \n\nOld good friends are trying to slowly bring me out into the world again while I try to hold down a new job without an active bar license in finance but haven't started it yet and still a bit concerned. What if I wasn't bipolar and this is just a way of a family trying to control who I date and what I do with my life because my father left my mother and us? One's life should not have to consist of driving around a single parent to work while my life was destroyed in the process of all this. \n\nI also noticed Dexedrine (straight D-amphetamine) doesn't trigger me the same way Adderall does when trying to treat ADHD, however, I can't hold down any job on dexedrine despite feeling more relieved so my psych has me taking xanax 0.5 as needed which is pretty much daily for me.\n\nJust venting a bit, thank you for reading in advance and sharing.

I take the Effexor XR 37.5 twice daily with my ADHD meds and I feel my ADHD meds more or more present if that makes any sense. Although I feel more present, I'm also more depressed since stopping the Effexor XR 75 mg once daily but I was too in my head if that makes sense to any of you so I needed to try the lower dose twice daily and the need for Rexulti 1.0 mg (psych gives me samples too expensive to get authorization for) is every day almost. I get a huge knot in my stomach and almost can't function without Rexulti 1.0 mg and the effexor xr 37.5 twice daily dose. Am I better off just taking my 75 mg once daily again even though I felt more in my head? \n\nto me, since I live in a broken home, it goes from me living for my single mother and driving her around failing to go out and establish a new relationship for myself on lower doses VS on a higher dose despite looking \"medicated\" or aggressively lethargic and confident I go out and have the ability to start a new life or relationship for myself. \n\nMy biggest worry is starting a new relationship for myself due to being on a higher dose of effexor xr, but everyone today needs what they need hope I am just looking into this too much and maybe need to remove rexulti or raise effexor xr and try to remove rexulti again.

I am taking an Executive MBA program, one class at a time (I know sounds worthless) just because any federal aid can help my financial situation until I'm stable with a job and then maybe can stop pursuing it. \n\nHoping to land this job or another different job soon, trying to get myself to study is the hardest part right now, fighting for something that took everything that made me happy from me because I thought fighting through all these conditions and suffering would have been the best way to go, when in fact, I'm not too sure but this window between graduation in 2016 and re-taking the bar every few months has been the hardest time of my life. I did manage to hold two pretty big internships over my law school summers, but maybe I'm just not cut out for this. police or fire dpt is always there if nothing pans out soon I guess.

Never knowing why I was depressed I kept going until my graduation and tried lowering my dose all the way down to Adderall IR 10 mg and was beyond agitated and angry at my graduation (should have not lowered my dose but my older brother that's always resented me and treated me like garbage, has been shadowing my doctor for his med school and got in his ear about me struggling for unemployment).\n\nI was in a 4 year relationship at the time with the love of my life and finally got a job offer for a political campaign down in Florida but my ex-gf said she wouldn't come with me and broke up with me, so I had a melt-down and failed my bar exam. On top of that, my older brother decided to completely destroy me and convinced a new doctor he knew with my mother that worked in her group that I was not ADHD and bipolar. my kidneys were on fire and I had a hand-rash. I couldn't move or function for an entire year and failed the exam again, my ex-gf tried reaching out but I couldn't even think straight, I was a disaster for a good friend's wedding and he still hasn't forgiven me for showing up on lithium, I was a mess and my ex-gf left so I gave up on my own treatment.\n\nIt's taken an entire year to go see a psych who flat out told me I was NOT bipolar and was being abused by my family for control. I'm now on Effexor XR 75 mg a diff antidepressant and dexedrine ER 15 mg with adderall IR 20 mg tablets. It's as if my goggles came back, I see everything clearer than ever, and does it hurt me. I told my mother after picking her up from work that she should be ashamed of herself with my brother for seeing me not function without my meds and ruining my relationship and trying to control me. No wonder I need antidepressants I can't be off them in my own disgusting toxic broken home environment due to my narcissistic mother and narcissistic older brother. You would think being in medicine they would understand, not at all, I despise them and I knew interning in the White House on my medication I was fine, yet they never visited me that summer, I wonder why? Now I know, it's resentment and because my older brother feels like residency will be awhile and is miserable, I'm supposed to not take care of myself and rot in my bed? No way. I just wanted to know others out there, that have been in similar situations, I interviewed for a full time job a week ago it went very well, hoping I get it because I need out of this toxic household and I'm never looking back again.\n\nThey made me believe I didn't need the most effective medication for ADHD and no wonder I haven't had any progress since then. Now that I'm seeing a psych that won't listen to the outside noise and saw the physical abuse signs (brother punched me off of all my meds because I was yelling at them), she won't give up on me. It's just hit an awkward point that I see clear and see the abuse now and if they feel they won't get anything out of me leaving this house, they will go at any length to keep me here. \n\nMy older brother is living back home now and I feel like he's breathing down my neck despite not sitting around him, it's beyond uncomfortable in my own home. I can't confide in my employer because I'd scare them away, so I wanted to vent here.

On wellbutrin xl 300 mg and this add-on called rexulti 1.0 mg (not necessary but it helps so I take it everyday). The real change comes in when I take an SSRI or SNRI. I first took lexapro 10 mg during law school when I was having a break down with an ex-gf at the time and I knew I was dealing with a possible high-dose stimulant addiction or needed a better medication or way out of the law school trap.\n\nI ended up on this antidepressant (SSRI) lexapro 10 mg with adderall and I immediately looked healthier and better, brawled with my toxic broken home and was finally living a real healthy life except I trued my ex-gf too much and she used me financially without me even realizing how much money was being taken from me. It was almost robotic that I was no longer present on antidepressants and all along my family watched me take a downfall and the truth was just unbearable so fighting my way out of this house with my psychs help.\n\nOn an SNRI like effexor xr 75 mg I felt like I had a light bulb moment and was not only more confident but very agitated and confrontational with my family as I should have been (however was probably looking medicated or high on the highest dose like lexapro). I went to an old friend's party on the highest dose and noticed something felt off at the party although I was with this girl that night there. I knew the 75 mg of Effexor XR wasn't working as well anymore because what felt like relief became depression again somewhat and I was going in circles.\n\nI asked my psych for 37.5 mg of Effexor XR twice a day which is the same dose of 75 mg BUT it affects me differently and I feel my ADHD meds more. I even possibly have a job waiting for me next week after just lowering it a bit. I try to just take one dose of effexor xr but it's impossible to deal with the additional anxiety on top of that at least at the moment. \n\nWhat helped me pass my first year of law school was adderall instant release 20 mg tablets and my psych gave them to me again with xanax 0.25 mg for anxiety and dexedrine extended release 15 mg which doesn't cause as much anxiety as adderall but helps me when I don't need to study. Seems like the bar exam and career is very dependent on adderall instant release and I wanted to leave the adderall behind me and create a new life for myself. \n\nI keep trying to lower my dose and just take dexedrine ER which seems to be the way to go because it doesn't cause as much anxiety but adderall tablets seem necessary for this bar exam prep (failed 4 times before and had a breakdown got dumped by ex-gf the second time).\n\nWhen I took too many adderall tablets with my dexedrine my artery in my head stuck out and it felt like it was going to explode so I'm very cautious with the adderall, but got to work with my psych to see what has to stay or go. thanks for listening anyone with knowledge of these meds, please help me out here.

I noticed when I was near a breakdown in law school, I was prescribed lexapro (an ssri antidepressant) that gave me immediate relief and a \"i don't give af\" attitude that literally drew women to me like flies on shit. My ex was a manipulative dime piece that did dry up my pockets, so it's possible she made me feel like a king when I was in fact dumbed down because by the end of the relationship I couldn't connect to other people on this medication and when I came off when she left during bar exam failures, I had a near breakdown.\n\nNow, I'm prescribed a new antidepressant effexor xr (an snri antidepressant) that when I took it at a full dose, I had the same careless effect on me that might have caused a little lethargy or medicated type agitation that gave off a careless feel, but I immediately went on dates slaying 8s and 9s living home not caring about the fact im living home yet wasn't seeing much job movement in between the window of passing the bar exam and graduation.\n\nNow my doctor lowered the antidepressant dose and I'm studying much more, interacting with people more, but more caring about my circumstances and not even sleeping with the girls i just recently slept with again. I'm just focused on locking up my full-time job that is pending next week and passing this exam in february finally, but I wonder why so many more women are attracted to me on a higher dose of meds. \n\nAre they blunting what I truly need to take care of in my life and hence why I may be seeing little more progress now (old friends starting coming around again etc. and feel less medicated yet on the higher dose I'm slaying birds and wacking off like crazy).\n\nWanted to share my odd experience with antidepressants coming from a broken home and ADHD struggles trying to get past this bar exam.

Now, my last hurdle is passing the licensing exam (failed multiple times, trying again) but was also in a relationship during the entire time in grad school with a girl I loved in a mostly sexual relationship.\n\nWhen I ended up taking lexapro 10 mg for depression, I felt immediate relief with my adderall xr 25 mg and my relationship got better (at least it felt that way, I was no longer shaking or nervous in her house with anxiety), but I became less motivated and focused on my own life. My family believed I changed for the worse and basically ruined my relationship with her and I guess I became too lethargic to do anything about it.\n\nNow, I'm on different antidepressants like Wellbutrin XL 300 mg and Effexor XR 75 mg but I can't figure out if I'm better or worse because I don't have classes to go based on anymore although I'm struggling for employment. I see my psych on a monthly basis and just wanted to share if anyone tackled the root of an issue or if an antidepressant helped you live your best life. On a higher dose of Effexor XR, I was going on dates and living my life more but I was also a little more lethargic and agitated at my family (as I think I should be if they interfere in any relationship I try to form on a full antidepressant dose that they claim to be mania or I'm not myself). On a lower antidepressant dose, I'm much more human and easier to talk to but also feel like more of a disposable human being just driving my mother to work etc. as opposed to living my life. The odd part is Effexor XR 37.5 mg twice a day I take now is the same as Effexor XR 75 mg (milligrams wise), yet I see things differently and I'm different on the one 75 mg dose than the lower one twice a day. After the holiday I'm supposed to start a job pending a drug test and if for some reason I don't get the offer, I know I need to go back up in dose and so be it if I become lethargic or more agitated at them.\n\nI'm close to 30 years old and hoping to be on my own feet this year, coming from a broken home is no excuse that I can't live my own life and have to suffer here forever. Thanks for listening, just don't know if I'm better or worse or if less is truly more. My psych has me this way right now so I'm assuming this is better although I am not as willing to go on dates like I was (cause don't have a job yet waiting to take bar exam again).\n\nAnyone go through similar situation, please share your input.

I specialized in sports law during law school and met a former GM of an NFL team during my program which led to a connection that I've kept in contact with him over the years and actually flew down to Florida a month ago to his team headquarters for an interview/advice about breaking in the NFL front office. He had a law degree like myself and got a break with an internship from a team and worked his way up, he introduced me to his football administration of contracts another lawyer who had a similar path and told me about his journey for a good hour. I asked him if I built enough on my resume for an opportunity (former white house intern, first year summer associate, nfl agent internship etc.) and he said yes, but after thanking them both for their time, haven't been offered a job yet (could be because it's still NFL season and  the off-season moves are made in January or so). I just wished them a Happy Holiday and plan on either taking a trip back down to Florida to meet with him again and tell him how bad I want an opportunity or continue through e-mails and hope something breaks, but I think I may need to take that spontaneous trip like I did the last time, what do you think?\n\nLastly, I just interviewed last week for an entry-level associate/law clerk position while my admission is pending and really hit it off with the HR lady at this firm in a nearby city which comes with decent benefits including a $200 card every month for commuting costs that doesn't come out of the pay. I told her I had another interview this week which I do tomorrow for the same position, but in my thank you e-mail to her I basically said I wanted to work for her and she suggested I proceed with this interview this week. She told me I wouldn't be starting until January 29th and would have to take a drug test and maybe a second interview.

I do live in a pretty toxic situation at home and sometimes think I need to do the opposite of what they say, but I end up looking \"medicated\" OR I'm more vulnerable and lethargic to them to do as they please with my life and I need to take charge. My psych gives me samples every month of a new med called Rexulti (antipsychotic antidepressant add-on) and on 1 mg it's done wonders except weight gain. I'm also on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg because I think it helped restore libido after being on an SSRI for so long and I heard wellbutrin stabilizes a mood for both ADHD/BP disorder.\n\nI am taking my bar exam a 5th time in February and despite memorizing a ton of laws and being able to recite them to anyone, I just can't get myself to focus on questions long enough to slow down or actually read them with the focus necessary to pass and do well. The increase of Adderall tablets from 10 mg to 20 mg was a good move but I can only tolerate half. Dexedrine Spansules ER 15 mg work the best for me because they don't send me into a spiral of anxiety or hyper sexual mood like Adderall does, yet I depend on that kick from Adderall to get going with these study preparations.\n\nIf anyone has battled a similar situation here, please share your input, losing it and don't know what else to do.

I have a long history of unstable employment and only held a recent job for two weeks before losing it on my broken home family members, feeling like they suppressed me my entire life and ruined my last relationship (but they claim I'm manic on antidepressants like lexapro 10 mg or Effexor XR 75 mg, so I've only been on partial doses and although feel more human, i think felt more at peace on higher doses yet others state it looks as though \"i'm on drugs\" when on a full dose of antidepressants, leading me to believe it may be inducing fluctuating manic states. I was put on lithium for 4 months and couldnt leave my own bed, had serious violent dreams and thoughts it was horrible, lamictal gave me a rash on my hands and after that I swore i wasn't bipolar. \n\nI'm also on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg which I think helped tremendously and rexulti 1.0 mg which is an add on antidepressant but the SSRI and SNRIs are the ones that truly change the way I see things or my chemical make-up or something. I've been on interviews on a lower dose of effexor with these meds and Dexedrine for ADHD instead of Adderall and had success just didnt take the job because it was too low paying. \n\nCan anyone with comorbid ADHD or similar experiences with antidepressants help me with their story or just input? I know we're all different and I should be talking to my psych, she gave me latuda samples I havent tried because of my bad experience with the above mentioned bipolar meds in the past.
