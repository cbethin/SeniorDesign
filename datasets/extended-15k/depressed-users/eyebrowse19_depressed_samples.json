I graduated college in 2016. The year after,  I worked on applying for medical schools. My physical health started to fail and in the spring of 2017,  I was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease that almost killed me. I  was hospitalized and eventually started treatment. My physical health started to normalize and I enrolled in medical school in the Fall of 2017. I  dropped out  early since my mental state started to decline and I realized I couldn't keep up with the material.     After that disaster, my self esteem plummeted.  I began a new job, temp to hire. Once again my depression started to interfere with my work and I quit after 4 months. I had the worst mental breakdown of my life the day that I quit.\n\n I soon began working at a fast food chain. Things were going well and my mood was lifted for a time. I received a lot of pressure from my parents to kickstart my career again, but I'm struggling.  My depressions started up again in october and it has gotten progressively worse. \n\nI'm running out of time to get my life together.  I'm 24 going into 25. I dont want to get out of bed when I wake up. I cant see a future for myself anymore.  I use too be strong, but now I'm not physically, mentally or emotionally fit for this world.  Im having constant suicidal thoughts. I'm going to try and seek help from a professional. It's the only thing I can do at this point. If it doesnt work then...\n\nI know this post was long but I just needed to vent.\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 402005, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The end is nearing for me...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9tvhaw/the_end_is_nearing_for_me/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "eyebrowse19", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_203q1zcf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541259368, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9tv11y/my_depression_has_become_overwhelming_im_starting/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9tv11y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9tv11y/my_depression_has_become_overwhelming_im_starting/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1541259370, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 401999, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My depression has become overwhelming.
