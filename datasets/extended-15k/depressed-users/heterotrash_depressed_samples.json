I've cut off pretty much all my friends and most of my family. im 17 years old and feel like im not going to live much longer. i genuinely feel as if im going to kick the bucket anyone of these days. ive done bad things that have haunted me since i was a kid and i think these are the bad things that haunt people for the rest of their lives. ive had bad things that have happened to me when i was a kid that i cant erase. i have literally no one to hang out with or talk to since i moved in with my nan and pop at the start of 2017. no one. i dont talk to anyone at school or anyone at home, i never talk to my parents but thats not anything knew because ive never had a conversation, or bonded with them even when i was a kid. i just never felt i could express myself to them or my family as a whole. and they all know that. they all thought there was something wrong with me like i had Asperger or ADHD, nope i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13 and i would say ive had it since i was about 8 or 9, and my parents would agree with that too.  i honestly feel i dont love them. i guess half of thats not there fault but half of it is because they never were accepting of me. they never made me feel like i could go to them for help or talk to them. a couple of months ago i cut off all my closest friends who i thought i was going to be brothers with for life or at least for a long while because they were the people i could express my self around, they were the ones who distracted my from the guilt and shame i only ever feel when im by myself, we shared the best memories together. honestly. i wish people could feel the happiness and sense of belonging i felt when i was surrounded by them. but i cut them off because they would pick and choose when they would talk to me. they wouldnt talk to me for like 2 months even though i would try and talk to them so i when they messaged me saying trying to talk like they didnt just ignore me for a month i told them we're not friends and there is nothing they can do or say to change that. i really am unforgiving of peoples malice i cant even forgive my own evil. i just get so angry with people. why do they have to do the things they do. why did i have to do the things ive done. i cant trust anyone. im virgin. i dont talk to any girls and i dont know how to. im so fucking insecure. i want a girl i can show all the passion i have to give but i honestly dont trust a single person in this world no matter what they say. i know the things people are capable of. im inconsistent with the gym. i go there and i see all the beautiful women and the good looking guys and i get so sad that i just leave. i dont feel any girl im attracted to will ever be attracted to me. i dont feel i'll get anything i want again, and i honestly dont feel i deserve the things i want or need. im tired of my family saying i have it easy and that i haven't experienced pain when they dont even know me. i wish i knew my biological mother that i haven't seen since i was like 2 or 3 years old. i only have one memory of her and it was of her and my dad fighting. my family act as if not having a relationship with her doesn't affect me. im not made of Steele even though it looks like it most of the time. i feel emotion. i probably feel more emotion than anyone i know. im always alone in my room listening to music so i can get a nostalgic high and think about the beautiful times ive had in life. ive got 2 days left until im graduating and my dreams of playing proffesional football seem so impossible. im playing bottom grade and im still shit. im a joke. i try to hold on to hope that things will work out but it seems so impossible \n\nI feel like im up against the ropes right now and i dont feel like fighting anymore, days are getting darker. im waking up in the middle of the night and seeing creatures in my room, i want to hurt people, i either want kill everyone around me or kill myself. i want people to relies how cruel humans are, they're savage in nature, they have no moral compass, people just follow there based desires. but even though life is cruel i cant help but feel ive truly had the most beautiful experiences. i cant even describe it. im kinda thankful that i see life the way i do because it i dont feel like and ignorant person. even though i think that thinking your not an ignorant person itself is ignorant. \n\ni just want people to see things the ways i do ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf",
