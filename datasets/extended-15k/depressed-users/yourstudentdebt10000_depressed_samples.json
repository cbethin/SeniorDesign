have no friends left. yesterday i found out my only friend who was left committed suicide. she was all i had left. she was the most kind person ive ever meet. i think im at rock bottom now. as if my miserable existence wasn't bad enough. every night i cry myself to sleep. then i wake up and repeat the same damn schedule every day. i try to make friends or try to get somebody to care about, but people just call me a faggot and walk away. nothing makes me happy anymore. i try watching or doing anything that used to make me feel anything but nothing works. the only thing i can feel emotionally is pain. i also recently developed carpal tunnel, so i cant even try at my dream of becoming a artist. i dont know what to do anymore. i dont even know why im posting this. its not like anyone is going to remember me after 1000 years. i just want to see my friend again. \n\nim on the fence about dying. but at this point i probably am going to do it anyway.  i kinda want to find a reason to live but im in  constant pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplease give me an honest answer i wont be mad.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id":
