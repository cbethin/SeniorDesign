I also have a fear of yelling now because I can still remember perfectly waking up to my parents yelling at each other and everytime I hear it I think people are fighting and get scared.

Makes me really sad because it's all the same.\n\nI'm like really really sad. I don't remember why I started cutting but it was when I actually had a group of friends. There were almost 20 of us that called daily and had sleep calls and stuff. I got really close to one girl in the group and when she left for vacation I was really sad. I felt alone for the first time in my life. She came back 2 months later of course but everything felt so different to me after that. I got diagnosed with depression after that and started cutting. Telling my friends about it they were supportive but eventually I just kinda screwed myself over by pushing them all away and now I have no one. I see them lots on social media about their favorite people in the friend group and all that. My cutting progressively got worse to the point where I used scissors to cut patches out of my skin in search of an artery cuz just cutting up my arm hurt too much. I got taken to the hospital after because my dad found out and I was on antidepressants and couldn't go near anything sharp for a while. 4 weeks ago I told my dad I'm better now and he thinks I'm happy. In reality I've tried to kill myself with pills multiple times and experimented with hanging. I miss my friends so much. I literally have no one. It's my fault to because I for some reason want attention but when I actually am wanted to be social I pretend I'm busy and can't talk \u00a0or just simply don't want to. I have cuts all along my left leg now and go down to the white stuff mostly. I have only gotten fat a few times. I sit in my room listening to music expecting things to get better. But it's been months and nothing's changed. I just play league, get banned for being toxic, and start New accounts. Cutting is just simply a habit now. Sometimes I do it wishing my friends could somehow see but most the time I just promise myself to do it for some reason. I have no idea where I'm going with life. I'm 16 and should be getting a job soon but how do I when I can't even find a reason to be alive. I wanted to kill myself so badly a few nights ago but don't want my parents waking up to that. I am 99 % sure I will kill myself the day I move out. So maybe death is my motivation to work lol. I'm just needed to get that all out.

Every cut just makes me want to try harder the next time. I did 15 over the weekend and it felt like nothing. I plan on doing a much much bigger cut within the next couple days. Every attempt to be better didn't work or left me in a worse state. I've done medication and excercize and socializing more and getting more sunlight and eating healthier and playing less video games and better hygiene. I can't even play video games if I want to now. Every thing exhausts me. Small activities are enough to make it hard to move and think. My memory went from remembering my wifi password to forgetting things I reminded myself of 5 seconds prior.\n\n  My family situation hasn't helped at all. We moved away from my mom after abuse and alcoholism and her suicide attempt. My brother and I spent a monthish in a foster home before moving to a different province. Then we had to deal with 3 more abusive stepmoms because my dad just needed someone. My mom complicates every visit and tried killing herself again. Last I heard of her was being with some druggy before her phone was cut off and now we can't contact her at all. I'm incapable of being open with my problems now because after I did I don't have any friends anymore but that might've just been me because I'm a difficult person to deal with. I try every once in a while to start being friends with people again but it just makes me sadder when they are gone so then I leave again. I get about 1 message a month now from someone who still asks how I'm doing.\n\nI've overdosed twice on antidepressants which lead to really awful days. I've tried hanging myself by which I mean just getting one step away from going through with it. I think I cry a lot more than a normal person. One time I used scissors to cut holes into my wrists because I wanted to cut open my artery. Then I got pulled out of school and had to go to the hospital for mental health and see a psychiatrist and school counselor and stuff. But I still kind of try to be happy. I really like plants so I started growing some things because it just feels so good watching things grow. But I only get to see them grow once a day. I guess I'm not really asking for help. I kinda realized I'm beyond help. So many people have tried but nothing works. I just accept that I am going to kill myself in the near future. I know what tree and the rope I will use. I picture it daily and see the tree when I walk to school. This is more of just a vent.

I'll probably get too scared again but this time I'll really try. When I was 16 and this started I didn't think it would get so bad. So I said to myself that I will give myself until I'm 20 to see if it changes. It's only been 1 year and I can't handle it. I turned 17 a few months ago (20$ and a happy birthday btw). My friendships with everyone that helped me just deteriorated. I can't keep a conversation with any one of them for more than a minute let alone even bring up any issues. My leg is messed up and disgusting because of self harm. Both my arms have scars up and down them including what looks like a suicide attempt scar. Everything is becoming harder to do. Playing a game takes all my energy but it's the most I can do to prevent myself from sitting there doing nothing. I've tried everything I've heard of. Counseling pills go outside more socialize more eat healthier exercise etc. I've overdosed twice in a half hearted suicide attempt. When every one is gone I've practiced hanging myself. All I needed so many times was a step. It takes me so long to learn things just because I'm fighting myself in my head while doing school work. I've been trying so hard to just be better but the last few months have just been awful and I cry in bed and feel so empty and can't figure out what to do so i just roll around and shove my face in my pillow. \n\n  Anyways I've been thinking more often than ever about killing myself. Weekends are just awful when I have no one and nothing to do. Imagine the pain of the excitement when schools over only to remember you are nothing and nobody and you can't do anything. What am I supposed to do all summer? I've gotten one step away from death so many times. This summer will probably be the last push. I know at least my dad and brother will grieve. I don't know about anyone else. But when I'm gone i can't think. If I can't think I can't feel bad for them. It will be hard until then though. So unless some miracle happens I think that will be it. I'm in bed early because I just can't do anything right now. I got into a game of league and cried through it so just ended up being wotthless.

It's been about a year now and it only get worse. I gave up all my friends because of my depression. I still have them all on messages right in front of me. But I just can't say anything. I'm too scared. Even if I could, is probably screw things up and lose them all again. Every single night for the past 5 months I watch my messages hoping they reach out to me. But even if they do I will probably ignore them. My cuts on my thigh have basically started coloring the skin with scars. I'm basically a suicide joke among people I know in my town. I'm forced to listen to music or be stuck with my mind. Even with music, I can sometimes think and it is awful. Every weekend I cut my thigh, usually worse than the weekend before. I get off school all excited about being able to do whatever I want. But then  I remember that school is a distraction for most the day.\n\nI've made a couple half-hearted attempts. The first of them was just simple trying to suffocate myself with a bag. I wasn't entirely sure I wanted to die at this point since it was still beginning. I did this several times and one time got so close I was gagging and vomited a little in the bag. Then I started using the rope from my bathrobe to tie my neck. I was still too scared so I just put it in the door and kneeld down until I couldn't breath and my vision blurred. Then I started saving my antidepressants. At this point I was sure I wanted to die. The first time I used about half of them because I got scared. I woke up with headaches rapid heartbeat and had issues moving. A couple months later I did it again but used about 6000 mg of them. I woke up hallucinating spiders dropping on my bed and freaked out. I even told my family about the spiders thinking they were real. I had the rapid heartbeat again. I was in constant panic. My head hurt more than I could describe. I had a terrible stomachache and was vomiting. My vision was all over the place. My legscouldnt support me so I fell and realized I had to crawl around the house. That was 2 months ago I think. Maybe more actually.\n\nCutting got progressively worse through the entire time. I started with a dull blade so I just poked holes into my arm with the point. Later I snapped off part of my dad's Olfa blade and used that. I had really shallow cuts all over my arm which my dad found one day. One day I happily rode my bike to the drug store and came back with a bag of razors. The first cut with a razor was amazing. It was so deep and was such an easy clean cut. I still have those razors now and use them to this day. Oh I forgot. Before i got the razors, this is actually disgusting to think about, I tried killing myself through cutting. But it hurt too much to do one long cut. So what I did was take the point of the Olfa blade which was dull, push into my wrist as hard as I could until it broke through with a disgusting noise. From there I took scissors and cut out little areas of the skin on both wrists in an attempt to find an artery and cut it. Obviously that didn't work so..\n\nBut anyways, I do weekly cutting now. I haven't talked with any friends on a personal level in months. I was fantasizing about hanging myself all day. I actually saw the vent and wanted to try but the vent wasn't put in right or something so I couldn't. I still have pills in my drawer but don't want to go through that agony again. I want to die so much right now but a couple things are stopping me. My dad just broke up with his girlfriend so it's just me my brother and him. I don't want him to lose another person. The other thing is I really don't know where I could do it. I've promised so many people I would wait till I'm 20 before I kill myself. But this is actually unbearable. It's only been 1 year, I still have 3 more years Idk how I will survive. I watched an anime tonight called The anthem of the heart. I was actually smiling and happy through it all. But the second it ended I was so sad and tried looking for another one but couldn't find a good one. So that brings me to now where I'm listening to music, just broke open a new razor and cut my finger in the process, and am getting ready to cut my legs more. I needed to vent because I can't sleep and am so sad sorry for the long post. I'm typing on phone too so sorry for spelling mistakes.

I don't think I'll ever forget the day. I woke up to a splatting noise. At first I ignored it but then I saw a little spider on my bed and freaked out. I flicked it away quickly but kept hearing splatting noises. Eventually I realized the spiders were dropping from my roof onto my bed and got out of bed instantly, threw everything in the wash machine, and tried playing games. But I noticed that I couldn't focus no matter how hard I tried. Everything blurred together and I couldn't keep track of anything I was doing. It kinda sucked because I had a league tournament that day and lost for my friends. But after I have up trying to play games, I went to make tea. My vision was going like crazy. Everything that was far away got closer and farther as I walked, and close things went farther. So sometimes is try grab onto something just to find out it's actually really far away and fall. My legs were also shaking to the point that they couldn't support me. First found out when I collapsed and banged my head. I went around the house on my knees and hands because I also needed to feel where things were since my vision was messed up. I would feel around and then slide in that direction. My heart was really heavy and rapidly beating too so I had a constant feeling of anxiety and panic. But after I made my tea and slowly crawled back downstairs, I just layed on the couch. My brother asked why I was out of my room and I just said I'm bored. I spent the entire day on the couch panicing except for when I lost the tournament. After the day was over I realized the  spiders were hallucination. Oh I also had a constant headache lol\n\nBut I still have about half those pills in my room. I really really wish I could swallow them all tonight and be promised death when I wake up. I want to do it tonight but thelast time I did it was just excruciating. I also want to hang myself so much. It seems so easy. But right now I can't. I still live with my dad and really feel bad for him. We've been through 3 different girls now and it all ended the same way. He s 47 now and I think he is just giving up. So he s really miserable because the 3rd just left a few days ago. When I move out though, I promise I'll do it. Nothing gets better everything is boring and my thigh is basically being colored by all the scars.\n\n\nSide bote: Hygiene doesn't help???? I have showed EVERYDAY except for weekends for the past couple years, brushed my teeth everyday since last year and even started doing sit ups and stuff before bed.

It's so unfair what it does to you. I cant be expected to hold friends when I actively try to push them away.\n\nA little over a year ago I was in a big friend group with people I played with everyday, we had sleep calls and even had a Skype call last 200 hours. It was the happiest time of my life. One girl in the group I really really liked because she was so friendly and caring. One time she had to go on vacation for 2 months and I think that's when it started. I stayed up all night to say bye to her but passed out and missed the chance. Then I realized I'm unhappy when I dont have someone like her in my life. She came back but I wasn't really the same. I wanted attention from her constantly and would hide myself whenever she would talk to the other people and forget about me.it progressively got worse to the point that it was rare for me to join a call with them. One time I remember she was watching something with her friends and we were going to watch one piece afterwards. So we did but didn't invite me to their call or anything. We watched one piece but I spent most of it crying. After a little while of this I asked my dad to go to the doctors and then I got diagnosed with Depression and took pills.\n\n  The pills never worked for me after weeks so I started saving them. While I was losing the group of friends I was also experimenting with my knife. It was really dull so i slashed away at the same area repeatedly with no success. One time instead of cutting, I dug the point of the knife into my skin and got really deep. I did this many more times and even felt bone one time. I also started pushing harder and could draw blood with slashing. One day I found my dads xacto knife and snapped off part of it. That was so much better and I could cut properly. Really shallow cuts that bled a huge amount. One time I hit a vein and it wouldn't stop bleeding for an hour. I was basically out of my friends group and snapped and told that girl everything. She tried her best to help but nothing worked. I told her she would give up because it's impossible to help me and she said she would never give up. We'll after a couple more weeks of no messages I sent her a paragraph and blocked her. Now I was friends with 5 people from that group still. But I had also bought razor blades and gotten down to fat. 2 of them are girls.  One of them I talked to about her problems as well as mine quite a bit but as of 3 months ago, I haven't talked to her nor she talked to me and the last message was from me \"Are you still playing terraria tonight?\" The other girl I stopped talking to on a personal level and almost completely but sill rarely talk to her. Now the other 3 guys.. I snapped one night and got in an argument and sent one of them a picture of a cut down to fat. He shared it with like everyone I guess. But he told the girl that I am someone else's problem now so.. ya\n\nI haven't had any interaction with anyone on a personal level in months and its horrible. No one to talk to sucks but its even worse knowing you had people to talk to but just can't. I was on the verge of hanging myself and had the rope around my neck multiple times over the last year. I tried cutting my artery. One time I used scissors to cut patches of my skin out in search of my artery. And remember those pills I talked about? I overdosed twice. The first time was a bad stomache ache and headache. The second time was hallucinations, vomiting, inability to walk, falling over, nausea, etc... it was a terrible experience.\n\nI played doki doki and the game is just crushing. It's like getting a best friend in a few minutes then listening to them relate to you and eventually die. It's almost like the same story as me honestly.\n\nBut anyways I'm really really tired. I cant enjoy anything. I cant be happy no matter what. I cant have friends. It's just too much. I've been cutting more frequently and am doing so right now. I've been actively thinking about suicide, even in school I can't focus because of it. I desperately want to die but I have a few things holding me back. I really want to know what happens with all the people I left. Like will they even know I'm dead? We don't live in the same town and they haven't seen me in forever so who knows. I doubt they'd care anyways. Also I really love my dad and brother and don't want to put them though it. I told my dad I was better and he would be so confused as to why I did it. But even with all that, I'm heavily considering trying this weekend by hanging my bathrobe rope over the door. Maybe my friends will finally miss me for once. I doubt I'll do it though.  I'm always to scared. But I'll try my best.

I didn't think much of it but eventually saw little white spiders on my bed and freaked out. I heard more splitting and found that they were falling from the roof. I panicked, got out of my bed, and quickly realized I could barely walk. When I was still everything looked fine but when I was moving, my vision was messed up. Things looked either farther or closer than they were making me step too short and collapse or step to far and do the same. I couldnt walk at all so I grabbed onto whatever was beside me to go throughout my house. I threw my bedding into the wash machine to deal with the spiders and even told my parents about it. I spent the entire day crawling around the house on the verge of vomiting just trying to do things. I also couldn't focus on one thing otherwise it got all blurry. So I just layed down on the couch with my family and a hugely increased heartbeat pretending nothing was wrong. I was shaky the entire time and was just completely incapable of doing anything. At the end of the day I realized that the spiders were hallucinations and went to bed to continue my terrible life. Just please don't overdose if you plan on killing yourself.
