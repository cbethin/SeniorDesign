I have been diagnosed with depression, social phobia, and a panic disorder. I live a pretty lonely life, yet I feel that I am fully capable of changing that. I told my him (therapist) that I just want a normal life, then he came up with the two questions listed above. Thinking them over these past few days, I don't think I want a normal life. I talk and joke around with my coworkers and other students everyday, yet I don't want anything to do with them. I feel like there is something missing when I try to connect to people, and the overwhelming weight of depression and anxiety doesn't help. So what is a normal life? Wife? If I met someone that I truly cared about, I seriously doubt I would tell her that I think about killing myself every night. Friends? I have a very hard time connecting with people. I think I am going to join a group therapy session, see how others are dealing with this. \n\nTL;DR \n\nI just want to know what your definition of a normal life is, and if you would be happy in your normal life.

My depression has worsened significantly in the past couple of months. I don't care about anyone, I don't care about my belongings, I don't care about my professor, I just don't have anything holding me back at this point. I have had depression and wanted to kill myself for as long as I can remember. I take medication, but it doesn't get rid of the pressure in my chest that is sadness.
