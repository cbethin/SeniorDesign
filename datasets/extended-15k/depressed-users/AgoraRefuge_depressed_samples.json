I've got a few questions I was hoping someone could help me out with.\n\nMy main problem is my strengh increases have stalled for the most part. I am an intermediate lifter, and I am currently bulking at a 250 calorie a day surplus. I have been consistently gaining about 2 pounds per month. I am confused as to why I'm gaining and not getting stronger. \n\nI'm not losing strength, I'm consistently completing my T1 sets, and hitting the minimum reccomendation on the first set of T2, and the exceeding the number of reps recommended on my AMRAP set. From there I I generally complete about seven sets for my T2, with each set starting on the minute. I do 2 sets of 4 working both muscle groups for my accessory work.\n\nSo what gives? It's been at least 3 months since I've gotten stronger and I have already tried a deload week to see if that would help. Am I misunderstanding the program?\n\nAlso, my test is low. Not hypo low, but about 420 ng/dl.

Zero desire to drink and do drugs when I'm not thinking about eating a bullet. Can anyone relate? If you don't use substances, how the fuck do you cope? People who do use substances to fight depression, have you ever found a better solution?\n\nAlso I have learned a few tricks I'd like to share. These are shitty coping mechanisms so I'm not advocating them necessarily but they kept me alive for a while so why not share. Don't do any of these if you haven't tried multiple courses of medication, several years of therapy, ketamine infusions and TMS. Treatment is always the best course of action, but you need to do something when treatment fails.\n\n1. Dxm can be substituted for ketamine. Low doses to get through the day, 100mg ish and an occasional high dose to achieve the same anti depressant effect as ketamine without having to deal with injections. It will only work a dozen times or so so don't abuse it.\n\n2. Hangovers temporarily cure depression for some with a low alchohol tolerence\n\n3. Sleep deprivation temporarily fixes depression. Don't need drugs for this one but they sure help.\n\n4. High risk- psychedelics like psilocybin can temporary fix depression, sometimes for months.\n\n5. Prescription stimulants will let you work while depressed. My doctor gave me an add diagnoses even though I don't have it to get my ass in gear. Worked for a solid 6 years. Modafinil is another good choice for working while depressed.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf",

I have been taking kratom for 7 years. The first 4 years I used kratom on a weekly basis, and then daily until about 6 months ago. Now I currently use it once or twice a week. My doses are 7-9 grams. I rotate strains frequently, and have never had an opioid problem.\n\nThe effects of kratom on me have changed, and I'm wondering how long of a break I need to take, or if that will even help. I had mild withdrawls from quitting daily use, but nothing to write home about. But since I quit daily use, kratom always gives me the same withdrawls, about 8ish hours after I dose. Like clockwork, I start feeling pins and needles in my feet, mild restlessnese in my legs and then diarrhea for about 2 days. Now I'd guess it's happened about 50 times, every time I've taken kratom since like March. It's obviously not unbearable but the pins and needles feeling is super annoying.\n\nThis is from single doses of 7-9 grams. I have taken as long as 2 weeks in between doses but still get withdrawal symptoms from every single dose. I'm guessing this is some kind of kindling effect but I'm not sure. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Were you able to begin responding to kratom normally again after a break?

serious advice. Thanks in advance.\n\nYesterday I met my friend for coffee. It immediately became clear he was balls deep in a manic episode, it was like talking to someone with a head full of acid. I understood maybe a third of what he said. It's obvious he is off his meds and is still struggling with self injury.\n\nBut that's not the problem. The problem is he has found a black market naturopath who \"diagnosed\" him with copper, lead, and arsenic (and a few other elements I can't recall) toxicity so the naturopath is providing him with chelating agents so he can self treat this supposed toxcity. As far as I know this is totally illegal and unsafe.\n\nThe way he described his body's reaction to the chelating agents freaked the fuck out of me. It honestly sounds like he is poisoning himself. Hot cold flashes, vomiting, tremors, etc. I am concerned he is using multiple chelating agents, because it seems like each agent is specific to a particular metal.\n\nFrom the small amount of research I've done, this could kill him. I tried talking some sense into him, to get him to see a real doctor to confirm that he is suffering heavy metal toxicity but he totally trusts this naturopath. \n\nI think it's important to emphasize my friend is not currently in touch with reality. It sounds like he hears voices, is prone to magical thinking, and I have no idea about the state of his cognition. My big fear is that he will disregard the instructions his naturopath is giving him in favor of a higher dose, and that could be it for him.\n\nI need to know exactly how dangerous black market chelation therapy can be. I want to call APS, but my friend is a drug dealer and he has multiple lbs of bud at his place. I only want to call APS if there is a HIGH chance of death. Him and all his coworkers (they have salaried positions and hours, can you believe that?) will have their lives totally and completely ruined if I call APS. The only reason I would do that to him is to save his life.\n\nSo can anyone give me some insight on the dangers of chelation therapy? I can see from my research that it has a long list of serious side effects including death, but it doesn't say how likely they are. If for example his chance of death was under 10% I will probably do nothing. Higher than that and I might consider action. Please give me some directions guys I am worried sick about my friend.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskDoctorSmeeee", "subreddit_id": "t5_33d9u", "subreddit_subscribers": 6874, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Worried about a manic friend- Chelation Therapy Dangers", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDoctorSmeeee/comments/92fny1/worried_about_a_manic_friend_chelation_therapy/"}, {"author": "AgoraRefuge", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1532655668, "domain": "self.legaladvice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/928br9/involentary_commitment_and_chelation_therapy_il/", "id": "928br9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/legaladvice/comments/928br9/involentary_commitment_and_chelation_therapy_il/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1532655671, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, since I know you guys are big on this don't look through my post history unless you want nudes.\n\nI have a friend that is bi polar 2 and currently unmedicated. I don't think that's a good idea, but that's his choice. Today he told me something that has me really concerned. He's really into naturopathic shit. He's been self administering chelation agents because he believes he has heavy metal poisoning.\n\nWhen he described his reactions to it, it highly concerned me so I looked into it. It looks like this is HIGHLY dangerous, even when performed by a doctor. I am afraid he is going to poison himself on accident. I know someone can't be committed unless they are a threat to themselves or others in IL. \n\nCould this be considered a threat to himself? It honestly sounds like it could kill him and he's not in his right mind, I am not confident he is even following the directions the naturopath he is seeing correctly.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "legaladvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rawz", "subreddit_subscribers": 450492, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Involentary commitment and chelation therapy (IL)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/928br9/involentary_commitment_and_chelation_therapy_il/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "AgoraRefuge", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1532560020, "domain": "self.dirtyr4r", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/91wujd/hi_mistress/", "id": "91wujd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "permalink": "/r/dirtyr4r/comments/91wujd/hi_mistress/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 3, "retrieved_on": 1532560021, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm a 25 year old dude and I would love to serve you today.

Whether I'm submissive or dominant, I absolutely love orgasm control and denial. There's nothing like the feeling of keeping or being kept in chastity for a couple weeks and then finally cumming. Spanking, bondage, and anal are big pluses. As a dom, I'm a big fan of texting instructions through out the day. Go into the bathroom at work and take off your panties, when you get home I want you to edge yourself 3 times, etc. The meanest thing I've ever done as a dom was making a sub text me for permission to use the bathroom for a week .

What are your experiences with chronic marijuana use? My doctor said that anything more than a few hits every couple of weeks is bad for your mental health.

I was completely unable to moderate my use so I quit that prescription after 3 months. \n\nI found kratom and thought I had a good daily solution. Fast foward a couple of years and I was in a pretty bad place. Kratom made me scatterbrained, and the highlight of my day was my morning 9.5 gram dose and posting on reddit.

Mild rls, and mad sensations of electric shocks in my legs and just all and all a bad time. Daily kratom use was clearly not for me. That was about 3 months ago. I'm mostly past the cravings, but every now and then I think I deserve a reward for a productive week, or I have an episode and feel just want the hurt to stop and cave.\n\nI had no slips ups back to daily use, but going longer than a week or two seems impossible.

I went over the basics of my symptoms, my past medical treatment ect. During the conversation I made 2 things very clear;\n\n1. I have been seeing a psychiatrist since I was 6, and I have tried 20-30 medications. According to my current doctor, \"psychiatry has taken me as far as it can\", and I was not interested in changing my meds unless therapy proved unsuccessful. I have severe multi month long reactions to even tiny med changes, and I'm not interested in going through that again. I was assured this would be fine and that the intake coordinator had confirmed this with the psychiatrist. \n\n2. I made it clear that under literally no circumstances would I consider residential treatment. I am not a danger to myself or others, and taking me from my phone, friends, girlfriend, pets, bed, home,family and placing me in an environment where I'm completely under the control of others would just make things worse. Again, I was assured this was fine and that the psychiatrist was aware of my stance on residential treatment.\n\nI made clear that the intake coordinator was to confirm this was ok with her psychiatrist. A few days later, I received a call back, and was told the doctor had said my 2 conditions were fine, and that they would be offering me a 2 week trail period in the OCD partial hospitalization program. Great! \n\nWell, it was great until my 2 minute meeting with the psychiatrist that I had 3 weeks later. After waiting 4 hours that is. I was told that I \"wasn't committed to getting better\", because of my stance on higher doses of anti-psychotics. I was told that because I was unwilling to change my meds without consultation with my doctor (whose actually aware of my 15 year prescription history) the only program that would be available to me would be the residential treatment program. Of course I said no. This visit cost me $1,4000.\n\nSince I would not have done the intake interview if the intake coordinator had actually followed up with the psychiatrists regarding my conditions, (or perhaps she did and the psychiatrist wasn't listening or had changed her mind without informing me), am I responsible for this bill? Right now my plan is to dispute it. I'm really upset about this, I would not mind going to small claims court. I also feel like if the psychiatrist had changed her mind about my conditions, she could have had the intake coordinator call me and let me know that and ask if I was still interested in the intake interview. She had 3 weeks to do so.\n\nWhat does everyone think? Am I going to be stuck with this bill if I get sent to small claims court? Or is it more likely they sell the debt and I'm left to deal with someone else?\n\nSo we're clear, I'm in IL.

If cost/thc ratio was your goal, what would you keep in your headstash?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DarkNetMarkets", "subreddit_id": "t5_2yt0h", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hash Oil Tiers Question", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/7547ke/hash_oil_tiers_question/", "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw"}, {"author": "AgoraRefuge", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1506648021, "domain": "self.Bitcoin", "edited": 1506648682, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/734lok/btc_noob_is_coinmama_screwing_me/", "id": "734lok", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/734lok/btc_noob_is_coinmama_screwing_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1506733723, "score": 8, "selftext": "Tldr; is the blockchain under heavy load right now? 24 hours and transaction hasn't gone through, should I wait it out or use another service to purchase BTC if I need BTC asap?\n\nHey guys. I have next to no knowledge about BTC beyond the basic how to buy and how to spend it. I normally use Coinmama, and my order from last night has yet to show up in my wallet. Last I checked the transaction had 76 confirmations. I know my address is correct, because I see the unconfirmed coins (I use Electrum).\n\nI asked the support at Coinmama why my transaction was taking so long, and the response was the blockchain was under heavy load. I don't really know what the means tbh. But support sent me a graph of average confirmation time as if to show that my transaction taking so long was because the times were so high. According to the chart they sent me the average confirmation time yesterday was around 12 minutes, not the 1440 minutes I've been dealing with.\n\nI need to get BTC as fast as possible. Do you guys think if I went to Localbitcoins or a BTC atm it will still take multiple days for the transaction to go through, or is Coinmama feeding me bullshit? Is anyone else having issues buying BTC?\n\nThanks in advance for your help =)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "thumbnail": "self", "title":

Recently, things have gotten to the point that I think its in my best interest to enter a day or inpatient program.\n\nThe problem is, I am dependent on cannabis and have been for about 8 years, and I live in a state with very restrictive mmj. I truly think it helps me, and the withdrawal symptoms I get when I stop dont seem like withdrawal syndromes. I become dangerously aggressively and stimulated and frequently punch or slap myself while screaming single words or phrases over and over. The last time I tried to stop, I think I may have had my first and only manic episode- I felt like I'd done a freakin 8 ball for no reason- my behavior put me at huge risk of arrest or a mental health hold, and I am lucky it did not come to that. I had never felt that way in my life before.\n\n I feel I get similar beneficial effects from cannabis as I do atypical antipsychotics like seroquel, without the intense sedation and demotivation. Since I get the same benefits from smoking left over resin as I do from smoking buds, I'm thinking its something other than THC that makes me feel okay. Right now, I cant enter a program because they all drug test, and I haven't been able to find one that wouldn't also force me into addiction treatment.\n\nSince I don't think its smart for me to stop smoking what I do (half gram to a gram of indica before bed), and since I don't want to waste my time in a drug treatment program, I was thinking of switching to a low THC high CBD strain. \n\nDoes anyone know if these kinds of strains have enough THC to trigger a standard 5 panel?

I'm not one to dicate what other people do, so I just told him \"hey man, just figured you should know that if you continue your usage pattern, you're going to end up physically addicted, and it's going to make your anxiety worse.\"\n\nBelieve it or not, next time I saw him the following year, he told me he'd stopped drinking on my advice- he's not prone to research, and didn't realize what he was doing was harmful. Unfortunately, it became clear he'd just replaced them with several times a week, high doses (8+ mg) of alrazopam or clonazolam. He's been using the ones with a longer half life a lot more. I'm going to see him later today, and he told me he'd taken 10 mg clonazolam the night before, and 8 the previous night. He does not realize he's still fucked up, and I think he's been in this place for awhile. I've tried to have the same conversation I had with him regarding alcohol, but I really think the fact that he has anxiety, and could theoretically get prescribed benzos makes it seem safe. That and the cognitive difficulties he's facing.\n\nI'm a big nerd, so my approach was to try and let him know how increases gaba-a transmission over the long term causes down regulation, and can even induce anxiety disorders. It all goes over his head, and I don't know any other way to explain it. I feel that since he stopped drinking when he realized it was bad for his anxiety, he might be able to do the same with benzos.\n\nThe problem I'm trying to solve is how to simply, and concisely explain from a scientific standpoint to my friend that what he is doing is actually making his anxiety worse. If anyone is familiar with any videos, or text explanations of why benzodiazpine addiction can be very harmful, I would really, really appreciate it. If anyone has any experience dealing with this sort of thing, would also love to hear your experiences.
