But here\u2019s the thing: this dog had no gear on whatsoever. No \u201cdon\u2019t pet me I\u2019m working\u201d vest, no collar aside from a regular black leather one, regular old leash. He just looked like a pet. Now yes, you shouldn\u2019t ever just go up to a random dog and pet it w/o permission, but she was getting annoyed at people ASKING. She expected the general public to just know that her dog was a service dog even though there was literally no indication that it was. Its also worth mentioning that she has a very large unique looking dog (blue merle great dane) and is bound to attract attention. \n\nShe kept saying how \u201clittle shithead kids\u201d were everywhere and kept coming up to her asking if they could pet her dog. But get this- she was at DISNEYWORLD. Of COURSE there\u2019s gonna be kids everywhere, of COURSE there\u2019s going to be huge crowds. Why the fuck do you act so surprised??\n\nThe woman has had other encounters like this one too. Its like she purposely goes out and attracts attention just to talk shit. I would never comment or shit on her because she seems to have a large following, and I don\u2019t like drama. But this makes me so mad. One of my friends is an army vet with severe PTSD and his dog is literally his savior. His dog does important work, and this woman and all the people that pass their untrained pets off as SD\u2019s soils the real ones\u2019 reputations. \n\nShe also has never specified what she needed a dog for. Its cool if you don\u2019t want to talk about your illnesses, but she\u2019s said multiple times that she got him just as a pet. And then when she goes out in public (again with no gear and no indication that this dog is working) but he\u2019s also my service dog- bullshit. She said she\u2019s been asked by management before of non-dog friendly places she\u2019s been the perfectly legal question \u201cwhat tasks does this dog perform for you\u201d and every time she can\u2019t give an answer. \n\nThen when they tell her to leave she posts huge long rants about how \u201cthe world is so cruel\u201d and \u201cpeople hate disabled people\u201d and all this extra af nonsense. If he\u2019s really that important buy a vest, buy a collar, don\u2019t take him to huge places where there\u2019s hordes of kids. \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "rant", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn2b", "subreddit_subscribers": 55857, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Stop using your fake service dog to be an asshole", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/9w4m67/stop_using_your_fake_service_dog_to_be_an_asshole/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "belgianmelon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2ega9ev9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541699216, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RATS/comments/9vc5v0/shelby_loves_his_fuzzy_blanket/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9vc5v0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#6df5e4", "link_flair_css_class": "four", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "CUTENESS"}], "link_flair_template_id": "5a184f22-3bf4-11e5-8bcc-0e8ad82823eb", "link_flair_text": "CUTENESS", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/RATS/comments/9vc5v0/shelby_loves_his_fuzzy_blanket/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1541699218, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "RATS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnh3", "subreddit_subscribers": 50539, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Shelby loves his fuzzy blanket", "url": "https://i.redd.it/txfm5n6s95x11.jpg", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "belgianmelon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2ega9ev9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541432501, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9uek7x/how_do_i_ask_for_help/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9uek7x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9uek7x/how_do_i_ask_for_help/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1541432502, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had a long difficult talk with my boyfriend last night about my depression. \n\nHe was drunk and after ranting to him about how dumb my day was he just said \u201cgod I can\u2019t take it anymore- you\u2019re so negative. It kills me to see you destroy yourself like this. I miss the passionate motivated woman I fell in love with\u201d which is true. I hadn\u2019t realized it but every day is negative. Every conversation we have I\u2019m either crying in the midst of a panic attack or I\u2019m complaining about something that isn\u2019t a big deal. He said he\u2019s not sure he can continue the relationship if I\u2019m not going to do anything about it. \n\nThat hit really hard. I started crying and we talked for like 4 hours. I told him how my depression had been worsening and how I felt like there was nothing I could do, that I didn\u2019t know what I COULD do. I looked super deeply into myself and really thought about it. I have clinical depression- I was diagnosed a few years back, but my shitty feelings were on and off so no one thought it was really serious. I was on medication for a while (Wellbutrin) but it didn\u2019t have much of an effect on my mood, and I dealt with some pretty bad side effects. \n\nI never really talk with my parents about that kind of stuff. I have a family history of mental issues on both parents sides, and there have been a few deaths by suicide by my relatives. My mom and dad just write them off as crazy and \u201cnot right in the head\u201d and avoid talking about it. I\u2019ve told my mom I felt depressed, but she has no clue about the extent. She\u2019s told me im \u201cjust lazy\u201d and that its all in my head. Every time I think about asking her for help I hear her voice in my head saying things like \u201cShut up, you are not depressed. Quit being so dramatic. You\u2019re just lazy. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d \nShe has no clue that most days I don\u2019t even want to get out of bed, she has no clue how numb and hopeless I feel 24/7 and that I\u2019ve seriously contemplated suicide almost every day for the last month and a half. \n\nThere are a lot of factors making it worse. I\u2019m at a school that I have nothing to gain from, I have an idea of what I want to do with my life but have no clue how to get there. I never wanted to come to college, I didn\u2019t feel like I was ready. I wanted to work for a year and buy myself a new car and just have the freedom to live my life, find myself, and do what I wanted. Instead, the $10k I saved through two years of hard work making $8/hr got taken from me and I was forced to use it for a shitty state school that had no programs I was interested in. My parents would rather me be unhappy at a pointless school than be a deadbeat loser that didn\u2019t go to college. Now I live with shitty roommates, in a shitty house that my parents don\u2019t have the money for, and they insist that I focus on school instead of getting a job. I\u2019m so lost. I have no clue how to get out of it. I\u2019m absolutely terrified of asking for help. I don\u2019t even know how to go about it. \n\nLast time I tried to reach out to my close friend Maddie in high school, she called the police on me. At the time I was going through an abusive relationship, and was dealing with some similar bs at home with my dad. I told her \u201clife is getting so difficult. I feel absolutely hopeless all the time and idk what to do. I feel like I have no one to turn to\u201d \nMaddie told me \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to do\u201d and hung up. 20 mins later, the police were banging on my door and told my very freaked out mom that they got word of someone who said they were going to kill themselves. (I never said this)\nAfter that Maddie bullied me like crazy, and made attempts to ruin my life. She told school administrators that I was doing hard drugs to cope with my \u201csuicidal thoughts\u201d and that got me in a lot of trouble (none of it was true) she also broke thousands of dollars worth of band instruments and blamed it on me, keyed her own car and told her parents it was me, and even went so far as to beat herself bloody and bruised and told our friends that I assaulted her. The entire school (not exaggerating. I had no friends in high school bc of this) hated me and shit on me for two straight years to the point where I did end up having suicidal thoughts. All because I tried to reach out for help. \n\nI tried to tell my therapist a few years ago that I felt this way, and she had a similar reaction. She immediately told me that if I was having suicidal thoughts I would be taken away and admitted to a psych ward in the hospital, and would most likely have to stay there for months. That scared the hell out of me, so I lied and told her I was fine. I don\u2019t want a whole situation like that... I\u2019m not a danger to myself I don\u2019t think... I literally just want to talk to someone. Whenever I reach out people make me feel like I\u2019m some sort of crazy animal, which is why I have such severe trust issues. \n\nIdk what to do or who to even talk to about this. I don\u2019t want to just be carted off to rehab. I just want one fucking person to just understand what I\u2019m dealing with and talk to me as a friend, not someone who\u2019s about to call the police on me and then banish me from their lives. I feel guilty too because my life really isn\u2019t that bad. Yes I don\u2019t like the school I\u2019m going to but at least I\u2019m getting an education. I live in a decent apartment, and I don\u2019t have to pay my own rent right now. I have a boyfriend who loves me, and parents and a sister who love me. I have a decent job right now. What the fuck do I have to be so upset about?\n\nIts getting harder and harder to cope. I feel nothing but sadness and rage and hate. I can\u2019t find anything that makes me happy anymore. My passions piss me off now. I have no direction and I\u2019m going insane. I feel hopeless. Its hard to picture my future because I feel like eventually I\u2019ll just kill myself anyway. I see the world for what it is. A cruel heartless place filled with people who are only in it for themselves. \n\nI want to get help but I feel like there\u2019s no one willing to listen. There\u2019s no one I can reach out to who won\u2019t shit on me, or freak out, or just be uncomfortable.

Basically I\u2019m in college and I live with 3 other girls. When we moved in, one of my roommates, \u201cAllie\u201d adopted a big male pit/boxer mix. \n\nNone of us were on board for a big crazy dog. She had her heart set on adopting when we moved in, as this neighborhood is one of the only ones with no pet restrictions. We all pushed her to get a smaller, or senior dog that would be somewhat easy for her to handle given her packed school schedule, 2 jobs, and sorority events taking up all her time. She basically said \u201cfuck you\u201d to us for that, and claimed she just HAD to have a \u201crescue pibble\u201d She took on way more than she can handle. The dog is young, extremely active, no house manners, and has shown aggression towards other dogs and fear/aggression towards men. Which is ok- The problem is, she was not willing to put the work in to manage/alleviate those issues. \n\nAllie basically ignored his problems. She left him in his crate almost every day for 10+ hours. She would throw a ball for him in the house for about 10 mins when she got home and claimed \u201coh that\u2019ll be enough\u201d \nHa cannot be out when we have guests over because he goes berserk. I had to restrain him one time when our friend came over because he was growling, lunging, and trying to snap at her when she came in the door.

Basically I\u2019m in college and I live with 3 other girls. When we moved in, one of my roommates, \u201cAllie\u201d adopted a big male pit/boxer mix. \n\nNone of us were on board for a big crazy dog. She had her heart set on adopting when we moved in, as this neighborhood is one of the only ones with no pet restrictions. We all pushed her to get a smaller, or senior dog that would be somewhat easy for her to handle given her packed school schedule, 2 jobs, and sorority events taking up all her time. She basically said \u201cfuck you\u201d to us for that, and claimed she just HAD to have a \u201crescue pibble\u201d She took on way more than she can handle. The dog is young, extremely active, no house manners, and has shown aggression towards other dogs and fear/aggression towards men. Which is ok- The problem is, she was not willing to put the work in to manage/alleviate those issues. \n\nAllie basically ignored his problems. She left him in his crate almost every day for 10+ hours. She would throw a ball for him in the house for about 10 mins when she got home and claimed \u201coh that\u2019ll be enough\u201d \nHa cannot be out when we have guests over because he goes berserk.

I found her as a stray in my backyard. She was about a year old, was dirty, malnourished and intact. We fixed all of her issues and decided to keep her. However, as time went on we found that she did not like my mom\u2019s cat, and as a solution, when my parents got divorced and dad moved out he took her with him. \n\nI still got to see her often when I would visit my dad, and it was clear I was the person she was most bonded to. She\u2019d always get so excited to see me, and would greet me with meows and affection whenever I would visit.\n\nHowever, as I got busier with school, I couldn\u2019t visit as often and she got really close with my dad. He had her for about 10 years (she\u2019s currently around 12-13 we think) and he recently got a new job in NYC, and he\u2019s in a corporate housing place that doesn\u2019t allow animals. He tried multiple shelters as well as family friends, but no one wanted a senior cat. \n\nI\u2019m in college and I rent a house with a few friends. I have space, so I decided to take her in. Its a little smaller than she\u2019s used to, and has no yard (she\u2019s used to being outside) but I think I will only be living here for a few more months so I think it should be ok for the time being. Since she\u2019s been here, she hasn\u2019t been her normal self. She sleeps all day and doesn\u2019t seem to want affection like normal. She just seems super out of it. \n\nIs it possible for cats to be depressed? I think she misses my dad. I feel like she can tell something\u2019s up. \n\nHas anyone ever experienced this? How can I make her perk back up? I have one of his shirts so she can still have his smell and she sleeps on it every night.

She\u2019s such a waste of oxygen\u201d) she broke a bunch of very expensive  band equipment (speakers, instruments, etc like I\u2019m talking $10k worth of damage) and blamed it on me, she keyed HER OWN car and tried to say I did it- which I got in a lot of trouble for, and she punched herself all over her body to give herself bruises and told everyone I \u2018assaulted her\u2019 (I fucking didn\u2019t)\n\n(Also When we got to college, her equally psychopath of a boyfriend tried to hit me with his car in the school parking deck. I made a police report about it which eventually led to me getting a restraining order against her.) \n\nAll of that was years ago, and I\u2019m still so fucking angry about it and idk why I can\u2019t just let it go. I think about it daily because I see her walking around campus every day like nothing fucking happened. She has a shit ton of friends that have no clue how fucking insane she is. \nMaybe this is the root of why I want to be such a dick. I never got any fucking justice for that. She walks around completely free, never got any consequences for her fucked up actions. And so many people fucking love her. I\u2019ve had people tell me I\u2019m an asshole for thinking she\u2019s crazy and people think I\u2019m lying about all the things she did. \n\nIm so hateful. I hate most people I come across and I feel bad about it. I have severe trust issues. I need to just grow the fuck up. I worry sometimes that the wrong person will cross me and I\u2019ll end up in jail for murder or something. Its for real like a blind rage and I know I\u2019m a grown ass person and I\u2019m accountable for my own actions, but the rage is so powerful I\u2019m worried it will be out of my control with the wrong dumbass. \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "confessions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq6g", "subreddit_subscribers": 230985, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I want to be a jerk to people.

We also were in marching band together, and had a lot of close mutual friends through that. He\u2019s a really good kid, and he\u2019s always been SUPER serious about his academics. He was the kind of person who was in all honors everything, top 10 in the school, and would stress tf out if he got a 95 instead of 100 on a test, to give some insight. \nHe\u2019s in his senior year now, and I know that\u2019s a pretty stressful time with college apps and all the bs you have to get in order before you graduate. It never seemed to seriously affect him though. \n\nThe high school I went to was all about their ratings, and super strict about how the students did academically. They pounded into our heads that if we didn\u2019t get straight A\u2019s we\u2019d basically be worthless nothings out in the \u2018real world\u2019. Its unfortunate but we had a few students in my time there that took their lives because of the pressure this school put on them. \n\nNow I hadn\u2019t talked to Carl too much since I graduated. I went and visited a few times and went to football games to see them (marching band performed at every game) but we never really talked like that or hung out. I still followed him on social media though, and the other day I saw a post on his \u2018finsta\u2019 that freaked me out. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact wording, and he deleted the post after all this happened but it was something like this: \n\u201cI\u2019m done with life, I can\u2019t take it anymore. I don\u2019t want to be here and I\u2019m thinking about ending it. Im not smart enough to pass and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m just going to be a failure. Goodbye\u201d \n\nNow how would you react after seeing that?? \n\nThe comments on the post were all things from his friends like \u201care you ok??\u201d \u201cCall me\u201d \u201cLife gets better\u201d etc \nI sent him a text asking if he was ok, and I tried to call him multiple times, with each call going straight to voicemail. He usually responds to texts/calls almost immediately, and he has his read receipts on so I figured his phone must\u2019ve been off- which was unusual during the week when he\u2019s at school. As the day went on I got more and more concerned as I didn\u2019t get a response. I texted and called a few of his friends and they all shared my concern, because Carl wasn\u2019t at school that day, and I guess he didn\u2019t respond to them either. \n\nI told my mom everything, and showed her the post and she got super concerned as well and we decided to call the police. We believed it was the right thing given the school\u2019s pressure on its students and things like this that have happened in the past. \n\nA few hours later I got a bunch of messages from Carl that said \u201cwhy the FUCK did you do that?? It was just a fucking joke don\u2019t you understand what finstas are?? Jokes!! You got me in so much trouble now I have to go to therapy and everyone hates me...\u201d etc\n\nI didn\u2019t reply because I genuinely thought I did the right thing. I didn\u2019t care if he was mad. But all of his friends and even some of my friends shared the same feelings as him. They called me an asshole and told me I didn\u2019t understand jokes and that I was a piece of shit for putting him through that. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s really been on that dark side, I can say for certain that suicide not anything to joke about even if you are just fucking around. No one else seems to share my opinion though, they all think I\u2019m a dick. Am I missing something here? Is it a thing now to joke about suicide? \n\nIf so, we live in a pretty messed up world.

He jumps up and bites people at the door, has pretty bad leash reactivity, and cannot ever calm down- no \u201coff switch\u201d \n\nLong story short, I live in a house with 3 other girls and a very rowdy pit/boxer mix that none of us wanted. The roommate that owns him got him because he \u201cwas really cute\u201d despite the shelter telling her he needs an active, firm, pit savvy owner (she\u2019s never had her own dog before and is gone most of the day for school/work- leaving the dog in his crate for long periods of time- 8-10 hrs a day) \n\nShe goes to a petco trainer twice a month but doesn\u2019t practice at all at home. Now I\u2019m not shitting on petco but I\u2019ve heard lots of stories about how their training methods do not work for some dogs. \nThe dog is out of control and I\u2019m very worried he\u2019s going to hurt someone soon. I have limited knowledge of training but I\u2019ve worked with dogs for 3 years and have a pretty thorough understanding of behavior etc. \n\nWhenever I (as politely as possible) bring up some things that might be useful to try my roommate gets super defensive and acts like I\u2019m a huge POS for even suggesting we train the dog differently. She claims her dog is a perfect little angel and I\u2019m only \u201chating on him\u201d because he\u2019s a pit bull. I love pits but I understand they aren\u2019t for everybody, and I think ignoring their original purpose and tendencies towards DA is ignorant and can lead to dangerous situations. \n\nDog\u2019s problems: pretty bad leash reactivity, does NOT like men, does NOT like other dogs, generally really crazy all the time- no off switch (not sure if this is just how the dog is or if he\u2019s really anxious), with people he\u2019s comfortable with he will jump up on you and nip your fingers when he sees you. Pretty sure this is excitement, but to people who aren\u2019t prepared for it its pretty off-putting. He weighs 70 lbs and has actually knocked a few guests over. He bit my friend\u2019s hand pretty bad the other day and drew a little blood. \n\nHis excitement (and I\u2019m also guessing lack of physical exercise and mental stimulation) is starting to turn into aggression, and I\u2019m really worried. However, there isn\u2019t much I can do as our lease doesn\u2019t have any restrictions other than a pet fee- which my roommate paid. I have talked to the landlord and there isn\u2019t much they can do unless the dog is actually really aggressive, which I don\u2019t think he is. She is not open to any other training methods and rehoming the dog is definitely not an option. \n\nI want to train the dog when she is not home, as its getting out of hand and I\u2019m worried someone is going to get hurt, and no one else seems to want to fix this issue. I have to live with the dog, as she dumps him on me to watch while she\u2019s gone all the time. Its a shitty situation but I want to try and help the dog as much as I can- this is kind of a passion of mine. We also have guests over frequently and a lot of the people that first come to our house do not want to come back because of the dog. \n\nWhat are some basic things I can do? How can I train him to have an off-switch? How can I get him to be more calm and relaxed on walks, and not freak out whenever we have guests over? \n\nAny advice at all is appreciated.

I\u2019ve done a lot that I am not proud of, and he\u2019s stayed with me for two years out of love and support. I expect so much from him and over time I\u2019ve realized how unfair this is. I\u2019ve in an unconscious way made him responsible for me which has turned the once happy loving relationship into a toxic one. \n\nLately he\u2019s been super down and I feel like its because I bring him down even if I don\u2019t mean to. I had this same issue with my ex, who broke up with me because he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I had a pretty severe panic attack when he was at my house the other day and it continued for a few hours.

I don\u2019t know whats ok to share and say and whats not, and I mess them up because I become far too dependent on my partner. I struggle a lot with social skills and reading social cues.

I barely get any time to myself, and I live for the weekends where I can relax and have chill time. \n\nMy roommate has a dog, and she\u2019s pretty active too. Tbh I don\u2019t think she has enough time for a dog, but I couldn\u2019t stop her from adopting- she had her heart set on it. Her dog is a decent sized boxer mix with a LOT of energy. I love dogs but I don\u2019t really connect with hers at all. To me he\u2019s annoying. He has a lot of behavior issues, like growling and barking at strangers, he\u2019s horrible on leash, and he\u2019s a lot to handle and deal with. Its embarrassing to walk him- I know people are judging tf out of me because he seems so out of control. \n\nLately she\u2019s been asking me to take care of him while she\u2019s out all day and night partying with her friends. She\u2019s gone for at least 10-12 hours every day. Now I don\u2019t mind doing that every now and then, but I feel like ultimately its her dog and she should be responsible for it. She asks a lot of me, and she never offers to pay me or anything. Its literally all day every day I have to watch this dog because if I leave him out in the house he\u2019ll destroy things. I like to go in my room and do homework, but I can\u2019t let him in my room because I have pet rats and I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll try to kill them. I did that once where I left him out and it turned into a whole fight between us because he destroyed our couch cushions. \n\nI live with 3 other girls besides her, and I feel like if someone wants to get a pet like a dog that requires a bunch of commitment and time, all the people in the house should be in agreement. Well, we weren\u2019t. None of us wanted a dog but she ignored that and got one anyway. I wish she would\u2019ve at least gotten a small dog, or an older one who wasn\u2019t so crazy and hard to deal with. \n\nMost of the time now the dog just sits in the crate. Sometimes when she asks me to take care of him all day I don\u2019t. And yeah I feel bad for the dog but he he isn\u2019t my freaking responsibility. Its her problem. But every time I try to bring this up she just gets pissed and it turns into a screaming match. She acts like I\u2019m a huge piece of shit when in reality I\u2019m just busy as fuck and when I have time for myself I want to spend it that way- BY MYSELF. She\u2019ll say this shit like \u201ccan\u2019t you just help me for once?? Its not that hard\u201d \n\nLike I\u2019m fucking sorry- if it was \u201cjust once\u201d then maybe I\u2019d be more willing but its literally every fucking day. I\u2019m getting sick of it.
