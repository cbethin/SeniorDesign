Believe it or not I am on good terms with my former boss but I just cant do it anymore. I was even working with my best friend and it wasnt always bad.\n\nI Just couldnt take it anymore...I really cannot explain the thought process any more than that.

It's great that I managed to finish however I am more depressed than ever.\u00a0\n\nI have to say that doing an apprenticeship was probably one of my worst decisions I have ever made. I lost my job 3 times and worked the most tediously long hours (20 hour days were quite common) it destroyed me. My body is shot, I have next to no financial results, or gained any good contacts and networks to peruse this path further.\n\nIf I see another cable or even a light switch it makes me shudder. I have literally tortured myself for 5 years with everyone around me encouraging me to finish it, and now that I have, I simply look back with regret. I hate the work, the people and the environment I was surrounded with everyday.\n\nI can't even do the job now without getting extremely angry and frustrated (not a good look for employers or clients). A simple cable run not going right will cause me to fume like nothing else.\n\nI have worked many jobs and gained skills prior, as a network architect and a telecommunicatuons technician. I am now 33 years old and once again I have persued a career which I eventually hated with every fibre of my being.\n\nMy depression has become debilitating. I don't leave the house anymore unless really necessary. I have lost all my friends, and don't even do things with my wife and kids. My brother lives next door but never speak to him. I think he's given up on me too.\u00a0\n\nI am unemployed and can't bring myself to look for work. The thought of being around people makes me want to die. Life seems so exhausting when people are involved and work is about people, either cooperating with or doing things for them.\u00a0\n\nI really need to find a career I can tolerate. But there is nothing that pays for you to simply exist. And quite frankly existing is feeling lile work at the moment.\n\nI am slipping further down the rabbit hole everyday.\n\nI do realise the irony of complaining about people generally whilst attempting to reachout to people.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "subreddit_subscribers": 64014, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why is living so exhausting?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9kbyc1/why_is_living_so_exhausting/"}, {"author": "Duckwingduck85", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_29obzbmj", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537849161, "domain": "self.mentalhealth", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9ip23h/looking_for_someone_to_talk_to_about_my_issues/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9ip23h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/9ip23h/looking_for_someone_to_talk_to_about_my_issues/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1537849162, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm finding resources lacking for such a simple request.

I have a mental illness which has pushed me to the point of unemployment. I cannot work on a day to day as I do not have the capacity to operate as most do. Most days I stay home unable to function. Not sure when or how exactly I became this way but I am here to get some advice with my finances not my mental capabilities. For now let's assume I cannot work in a traditional manner.\n\nI own my own home outright (no morgage) asset value is over $1.5m AUD, two cars (2011 station wagon and 2005 small sedan), 3 dependants (two kids under 5yo and my wife). I am 33 years old.\n\nFortunately my immediate family and their business has had some great success (I do not work for them I am simply a beneficiary) over the last 10 years. I recieve $2000 AUD a month, this is my only income at the moment, and although it isnt much, my circumstances do allow me to take this pretty far in our day to day living.\n\nMy wife and I are completely debt free. She is a former primary teacher but since we had children she hasn't worked. To be honest she may have similar mental issues but that's a discussion for another sub. For now, at least, she cannot work either, however she is fantastic at not only being a mother but educating our children, so for the time being I would prefer she remains in this position. She seems happy where she is.\n\nI am a licensed electrician, a network architect and a telecommunications technician. I developed these skills over the last 10 years. Unfortunately these skills require abilities which contradict my capabilities due to my mental health. I was looking at other options such as purchasing a business or other similar investments related to my studies.\n\nWe are not very outgoing people, we do not live above our means or over extend ourselves. No restaurants or eating out, no material or impulse purchases, we do not drink, and our expenses are necessities such as; food, electricity, water, gas, internet etc. We occasionally go on a holiday to our family beach house but that is the extent of our holidays at the moment. I personally don't like traveling but my wife does so I would like to make this a possibility for her and my children.\n\nSo that's pretty much it. I know I may have left out a few details and you may have questions before you give any advise and I will try to answer the best I can.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nTL;DR I am in a good position to propel myself and family further financially but due to my mental health I am hindered.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "personalfinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "subreddit_subscribers": 13248348, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I am in a very good position which I would like to capatilise on but dont know where to start.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9i4hbo/i_am_in_a_very_good_position_which_i_would_like/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}]}
