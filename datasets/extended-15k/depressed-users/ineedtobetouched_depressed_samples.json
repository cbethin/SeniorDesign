I've been diagnosed with depression 13 years ago. I have nothing to hold onto. I finished my college degree but it is worthless. I quit my cashier job and disappeared in another country for 5 months during my last episode. I have no family. I currently sleep on an acquaintance's couch. I feel like nothing will get better. I have a couple job interviews in a few hours but i can't go there. I didn't leave this couch in 7 days. Only to pee. \n\nI'm embarassing. I'm humiliated. I've been crying every single night and as soon as they leave in the morning, I cry all day. \n\n\nI can't always run to another country. I'm just a rat. A disgusting rodent that is nothing good to society. \n\nI just want to go away. To disappear. I don't know how to start over. I just want it to end. I wish i could pay someone to kill me.\n\nWhat are the reason to continue? I just want to not be an embarrassment. I'm a fucking failure. I am filled with shame. \n\nI tried to eat sushis to feel happiness it didn't work. I bought myself a red lipstick to feel more confident it doesn't work. I open the window and try to BREATHE the sun and i don't feel better.  \n\nI can't stop crying.
