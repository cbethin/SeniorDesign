I live in a nice house is one of the nicest places in America with lots of possessions, so on paper I am really lucky, but in reality I am not.  I am currently in high school and am the oldest child in my family.  However, since the next oldest kid in my family came while I was still a baby, I never got much attention from my family as a child and ended up started off my life with an emotional detachment disorder that still negatively affects how I bond today.   Although I am very smart, I was also diagnosed with several pragmatic disorders at a young age that cannot really be improved, so I stutter very often and sometimes I just completely freeze in the middle of my sentences because I physically cannot communicate what I am thinking.  As you can imagine, it\u2019s stuff like this that has impaired my social development since a young age.\n\nMore and more siblings kept coming as I got older, making me drift further and further away from the rest of my family.  Not only did I never get emotionally attached to my parents, but my parents seemingly never got attached to me, setting the stage for mental and emotional abuse throughout my life.  I always got bullied throughout elementary school, but luckily I had several friends who would look out for me.  Towards the end of elementary school for the first time I finally felt like I fit in somewhere for the first time in my life.\n\nIn middle school I met a couple good friends, but other than that nothing too uneventful happened.  I got extremely into video games as they always gave me an escape whenever I was feeling down or bored.\n\nAnd now we get to high school, where everything went to absolute hell for me.  I gradually started losing good friends of mine which really kicked off my depression, and when I lost my all time greatest friends, I really lost it.  I started getting in fights, heavily drinking alcohol, and even doing really hardcore drugs to the point of ODing several times.  On top of that, the past ignorant attitude from my parents turned into a more abusive attitude where they constantly put me down for my impairments and slightest daily errors.  Although I have never directly made an attempt on my life, I have had more of a \u201cI don\u2019t care what happens to me\u201d attitude while doing some dangerous stuff.  The people who I thought were my last friends, instead of giving me support, boycotted our friendship until I stopped being depressed.  Now, I am left with absolutely nobody left in my life.\n\nAlthough I am writing this thinking that it will make me feel better, deep down I know it will not.  I literally have nothing to lose.  All of the physical and mental scars that I have gained will stay with me the rest of my life and will keep me from ever feeling normal.  The only thing that keeps me from ever actually ending it all is my younger siblings that I don\u2019t want to grow up without an older brother, but I know that one day I will finally get completely fed up of my failure and end my fruitless existence.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 407113, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ybplj/i_need_help/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "daddyBones23", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2dytqyfc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542417721, "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/9xs8xc/people_of_reddit_can_you_help_me_improve_my_human/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9xs8xc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/9xs8xc/people_of_reddit_can_you_help_me_improve_my_human/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542417722, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello people of Reddit.

He ended up apologizing about two months after all this, but at the time I was still mad for whatever reason and I did not want to hear it.  I ended up apologizing later on, but at that point he had already moved on and decided that he didn\u2019t want to be around me.  Most of the people who sided with him decided not to be friends with me anymore, give or take a couple people, so I really have no close friends anymore.
