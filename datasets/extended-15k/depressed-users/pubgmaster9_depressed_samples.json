I have only been taking it for 8 or or days, and my libido is already declining. My girlfriend and I went to Mexico for a few days for my birthday, and she constantly wanted sex, and I gave in, but I did not enjoy it and struggled with anorgasm, even though she tried really hard to help me. \n\nI am wondering if anyone had issues like this with lexapro, and switched to another drug that didnt have this massive of a side effect, while helping them with their depression and anxiety.

I'm being very open about the issue I've started having. \n\nI started taking lexapro a little over a week ago now. My girlfriend and I went to Mexico for 2 days, and had sex multiple times. Each time, we had penetration for over 40 minutes, and I felt almost nothing. She would even give me a blowjob for over 20 minutes, and I wouldnt come close to an orgasm or anything. A few times while having sex, I would go soft too and lose interest in continuing. I was only able to orgasm once, and that was after penetration for an hour, then me masterbaiting over her. She told me at the end of the trip, that she understands it's the drug I'm taking, but the sex lasting this long is hurting her. \n\nI am only 21, and this is crushing my confidence. I started doing research on lexapro and other anti depressant drugs, and it seems to be very common. \n\nDo any of you guys take an antidepressant, and still have a normal sex life? I would rather work on other ways to fight depression and anxiety, then ruin my sex life.

I told her I was very uncomfortable with this, and didnt like her talking dirty with other guys and girls, and asked her if she would stop. She said she would, but she still has been participating in the group chats for the past week. \n\nI'm not sure what to do, since she is unwilling to give this up, and it's not something I'm comfortable with her doing. \n\nTldr; my girlfriend is in group chats, sends porn and hentai, wont leave them.
