However just lately everything is just boring I mean my emotions are like not there I don\u2019t get happy I don\u2019t really get sad I mean if you count sad as questioning what I\u2019m doing with my life then yeah I get sad. But like I\u2019m just lost what to do right now like I really think something else is wrong with me, I have violent thoughts. Like for example someone will annoy me in the slightest and instantly my mind will wonder in my mind I play out how I will kill them with anything near me then watch as it unfolds. Like I constantly imagine in my mind stabbing someone in the neck with my pencil and watching the blood spurt out just because they said something annoying to me or whatever. Also another thing I always wear my hood, at first it was to just mask my hair but now even tho I have a new haircut and I like it I still wear it like me and my hoodies hoods have bonded like it\u2019s just natural for me anywhere and everywhere to wear a hood wether it be 90 degrees out or 20 degrees out, I even wear them during my or class.

I\u2019m a skinny tall white kid who isn\u2019t strong and is cast out because of my anti social behavior leading others to think I\u2019m some \u201cthug\u201d but in all honesty the final blow was today when I was told I\u2019m the worst fighter they have seen and my whole group agreed which it shouldn\u2019t effect me but It was all I was holding onto that hey I\u2019m crazy and atleast I can defend myself but I guess I\u2019m just no better fighter then a 6 year old child. They said I throw a lot of punches and miss them all and that I\u2019m worse then people who never have actually fought like just imagine your holding onto something like let\u2019s say your holding onto a job you really love and it\u2019s the only thing you have left and then for all your close friends to tell you that your the worse at the job, that people who have never worked in that field are better then you.
