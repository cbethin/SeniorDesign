But I\u2019m just having a horrible day. The past few months have been bad for me. It all started at the end of May when I adopted my aunts two 16 year old cats (brothers from the same litter). My aunt died of colon cancer in 2014 and her husband was going to put them down because his new wife didn\u2019t like cats. I obviously took them in. They were her babies and that was one of the most important things she told me when she was dying, \u201cmake sure my boys are taken care of\u201d. They were afraid at first but quickly warmed up to me and have become my constant companions. I was working at a law firm at the time and was a law clerk there for almost three years..then my panic attacks started up again at the beginning of June. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since I was seven, so none of this was necessarily new to me. What was new, was not having some reason for it to happen; before there was always some reason for the anxiety and depression. The work started to overwhelm me, I would often show up late to work because I would have to pull over on the side of the road on my way because of panic attacks. I then started vomiting almost everyday within an hour of being there. I started to drown in my work, becoming overwhelmed with the simplest task I had done thousands of times. This lasted two weeks. I finally told my boss I couldn\u2019t do it anymore, that I needed to put in my two weeks. He kindly told me it was okay, and that I could just be done right away. Thus began three months of crippling anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. I would lie to everyone and say I was fine. When in reality, all day everyday I was paranoid I would get a call from my old employer, saying I fucked something up or cost the firm thousands of dollars. The anxiety would only begin to let up about a month and a half after a quit (so August 2018). After this paranoia phase finally ended, the reality that my savings was running out and I needed a new job sunk in. The procrastination started, telling everyone \u201coh, I\u2019m looking for employment!\u201d When I actually would just sit in my apartment all day, smoke weed and contemplate killing myself. I would run my finger vertically along my wrist, imagining actually slitting them. Then of course, I realized I would never actually do it because what if at the last second I changed my mind. By mid September, I was missing credit card payments, not paying my energy bill on time because I didn\u2019t have the funds, etc. I knew I had to do something, but I couldn\u2019t. The only solace I had were the two cats. They comforted me. Anyway, at the beginning of October, I finally got a job as a waitress at a local diner. I had two options: kill myself or get a fucking job. I finally started to feel like myself .. normal, independent me who still had crippling anxiety and depression, but I started to function again. Well, today, I had to make an appointment with the vet to put the cats down. I am devastated. They have declined in the past month... drinking too much water, eating five bowls of food a day but loosing weight, throwing up, peeing everywhere, etc. Last week, the vet told me they were both in end stage kidney failure. I am crushed. I feel like I have let them down. I feel I am letting my aunt down. These are all irrational thoughts, I know. And I know I\u2019m rambling.. but I am so just so sad. I am wallowing in self pity tonight. I know that if I could dig myself out of the hole I was in not three weeks ago, I can handle this. But I am just very depressed. I have put my happy face on but I\u2019m tired of faking it. At least, just for tonight. The boys got me through one of the most difficult times in my life so far and not having them around is going to be so hard for me. Again, sorry for rambling. If this post doesn\u2019t belong on this sub let me know. Thanks.

She is a blast and I love her very much. \n\nThree weeks ago, I got a text from my ex-godfather (his wife, my aunt and godmother passed from cancer four years ago.. the guy is a prick) letting me know that he was giving my aunts two cats (she loved them more than anything as she never had children) up to the humane society and wanted to see if I wanted them as they are ten years old and cannot be separated. Knowing that no one would adopt the two brothers, I obviously took them. \n\nI started things small, letting my female cat smell them on my hands, slowly introducing them over the course of a week and a half. My aunts kitties are very comfortable with me, cuddly and happy. However, one of the boys and my female cat are at odds. They hiss, they hit each other (occasionally just sniff and walk away). \n\nIt\u2019s been a week since they have all been fully integrated with each other and they just don\u2019t seem to be getting more comfortable with on another. I have separate litter boxes and food and water bowls so they have their own spaces as well. \n\nShould I be worried? I have no idea how long this takes. Does anyone have tips as to what I can do better?? Thank so much in advance!!

I was sad but knew it was for the best. My mom is the warmest most loving person i know and loves taking care of people. My father is a hard ass, but has a huge heart and this divorce has made him a better, more humbled person. Their divorce was finalized in July of 2013. My two siblings and I along with my mom were living with my grandmother during this time and my mom was going out a lot with old friends from high school, which was tough because my siblings felt very alone.\n\nAnyway, my mom turned 51 in January of 2013 and this guy we didn\u2019t know threw her a birthday party at a bar; I was underage and obviously I couldn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t know this man, but he was friends with my mom on Facebook and they sort of knew each other in high school. They were definitely dating but my mom wouldn\u2019t admit it. In April 2013, my sister (23) and I moved out together because we couldn\u2019t take where we were living and we were not supporting my mothers actions. We attempted to express our feelings but she would get defensive, which was unlike her. We felt like we were loosing our mom and thought if we lived separately we would be able to work on our relationship with her. Unfortunately my little brother was 15 at time and had to stay, I still feel guilty about leaving him to this day. My sister and I only lived together for 7 months before she kicked me out. There was a lot going on, I had just turned 19 and was depressed and didn\u2019t really do my part aside from paying rent and she got sick of it. I moved back in with my dad which was a great choice for me. Fast forward to October  2013 and my mom and this guy who threw her the birthday party were officially dating. I hadn\u2019t really met him yet and didn\u2019t exactly care to. I could tell my mom was kind of going through a midlife crisis which is understandable because her whole life just changed in the passed year. I finally met this guy around Christmas time. My mom and him were extremely serious. Our first outing with him we went to a local restaurant where he sat on his phone scrolling through Facebook the whole time and asked my siblings to leave the tip. This man was lazy, unattractive and cheap. Not a good first impression. Christmas Day my mom left my now 16 year old brother at home after our Christmas celebration to spend the night with him. My brother was sad and alone and left by himself with my 90 year old grandmother. This set me off. I told her how I felt and again, she got defensive. \n\nIn March of 2014 my mother\u2019s sister and my godmother tragically died of stage 4 colon cancer. We were devastated. At the funeral, my mother asked my father not to attend. This was his sister for 28 years. She didn\u2019t want him to come because he was unaware that my mom had a boyfriend and she didn\u2019t want him to know yet. I was pissed. At the funeral he acted like he knew my aunt for years and I was put off along with the rest of my family, who couldn\u2019t stand him.\n\nHe claims to be a contractor who works on homes. He promised to work at my grandmas house to fix up some things and never did. This happened many more times, unfilled promises. \n\nIn April of 2014 I logged on to Facebook and saw a picture that he had posted of a ring on my mothers finger, an engagement ring. A few minutes later I got a call from my mom telling me the \u201cgood news\u201d and I was so upset. Beyond upset. I knew my mom deserved someone who could provide for her and support her and this was not the man. \n\nThe reason for the quickie proposal was because he wanted to cheer her up after her sister\u2019s death. My siblings got zero heads up and our permission was not asked. I finally met his daughters; two girls who did drugs and didn\u2019t work and neither graduated from high school. They told me their dad barely worked and was pretty much \u201cbipolar\u201d.  They said he was never around when they were kids. This was obviously a red flag. \n\nThey got married in September of 2015. \n\nFast forward to January of 2017 and they live in his small house which is cluttered and frankly gross. My mother was always a clean person but now she is living in a pigsty. He was controlling and didn\u2019t work. My mom has the health insurance and provides for him, working 40+ hours and week making $13.00 per hour.  He sells models on eBay and is a hoarder. My brother lives in the basement. He lives on a cement floor which my step father promised to carpet for two years but never did it. \n\nHe got in a car accident and had a torn meniscus from it in January of 2017. He has not worked since then and continues to collect \u201clost wages\u201d from his auto insurance company. In fact, I am the person that gets him this money because I work for the attorney that is handling the accident. If the insurance company doesn\u2019t send his money on time, he calls and blames me for it.  He claims that he made so much money before the accident however, in order for me to collect his lost wages I had to submit his tax returns for the past three years to his insurance company. According to his taxes, he made a combined total of $23,000.00 over the course of three years. \n\nIt\u2019s getting to the point where I can\u2019t keep my mouth shut anymore. I have kept my feelings to myself out of respect for my mother but I don\u2019t think I can anymore. I can\u2019t imagine this man being in my life as my step father for the rest of my moms life. My dad is a hardworking man who always provided for his family. This guy doesn\u2019t provide anything to my mom. She acts like she loves him and puts on a happy face but I can tell she knows she made a mistake but WILL NOT ADMIT IT. Someone please give me advice. I know this is super long but please help me. I am carrying this resentment against this man and it is making me an angry person. What do i do? \n\n\ntl;dr I cannot stand my stepfather and I am having trouble keeping my mouth shut about my feelings. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "subreddit_subscribers": 1041075, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (24F) cannot stand my stepfather.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8569rs/i_24f_cannot_stand_my_stepfather/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "dansrh567", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520465482, "domain": "self.thebachelor", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/82sxx7/unpopular_opinion/", "id": "82sxx7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/thebachelor/comments/82sxx7/unpopular_opinion/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520524570, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 27, "selftext": "Listen, I really liked Caroline on the show.

not doing much research on her relationship with Raven, I assumed they had been friends for years. Well, as I was creeping through Tia\u2019s Instagram, I noticed that the first picture (as far as I could see) where Tia and Raven were photographed together was April 24, 2016. Between the first photo to September 18, 2016 about 5 posts on Tia\u2019s Instagram included Raven. The first post in April had a pretty generic caption. However, the closer it got to Raven being announced as a contestant on The Bachelor, the captions got more involved; Tia referred to her as her best friend and sister. Keep in mind, Tia posts A TON of pictures (more so before she was a contestant). Now I could be totally off base here and I sure I am... and I really don\u2019t want to upset anyone but I think this is just interesting and I\u2019m not making any accusations, it\u2019s just a stupid observation. Anyway, around the time the first photo was taken would have probably been around the time Raven would\u2019ve applied for The Bachelor, and by the time July and August rolled around I\u2019m sure that Raven already knew she was going to be a contestant. This whole bestfriend ship that suddenly appeared just as Raven was going on The Bachelor just seems a little odd to me.  Who knows? I\u2019m sure I am totally wrong. I don\u2019t know, I guess I just felt from watching them together that they have been best friends for years.... just kinda fishy I guess.
