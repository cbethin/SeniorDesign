uhh this is my first time here really/I\u2019m using a throwaway, I hope this is the right place to post this! So just some background, I\u2019ve always masturbated to porn and it\u2019s hard for me to actually get off if I\u2019m not using it, without it, it takes me about 30 mins to an hour which is way too long for me. \n\nI\u2019m in my first LDR and I\u2019m seeing her sometime in November, but that could change. She\u2019s never masturbated or have had sex before, we\u2019ve done some things over the phone and I was able to get her off. I top about 99.999% of the time, but I want her to try and go down on me too, but I want to actually \u201cfinish?\u201d for her, I\u2019ve never been able to actually cum during sex even if I\u2019m the one touching myself? I have no problem getting horny or wet or anything, maybe it\u2019s the fact that I\u2019m so used to porn? Does anyone have any experience or advice? Thank you! Again sorry if this is the wrong place to post this/has been posted before, I just wanna be able to actually fix this problem before I see her!
