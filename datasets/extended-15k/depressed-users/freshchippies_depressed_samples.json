This year has been particularly bad, with more bad days than good ones. I track my mood religiously so I can remember that I do actually have good days, and this year has definitely been on the severely depressed side. I have had good days and good times and periods of happiness, and then it seems the depression comes back.\n\nFeeling particularly down and hopeless today for a number of reasons. I was proud of myself for going to work and staying at work, and not buying unecessary purchases in an effort to make myself feel better temporarily. So there were some wins. But the whole day I have been thinking about suicide (for about the 50th time in the last few months) and wondering why I persist when I will likely be chronically severely depressed for the rest of my life.\n\nI have a number of other health problems, one of which has no cure except multiple surgeries and constant monitoring. I try not to think about it because there is nothing I can do right now, or in general, but sometimes it gets me down. I am in considerable debt and my family is desperately poor. My whole family suffers from depression so sometimes we make eachother worse. My mother is sleeping on the couch in my tiny one bedroom apartment because she's essentially homeless and has nowhere else to go. She's been here for three weeks now and there's no end in sight. I love my mother dearly but we do not do living together terribly well.\n\nI have come to generally loathe my job but I'm too depressed to find another - I've been rejected for a number of ones I've applied for in the last six months - and I'm afraid I will never be qualified for a higher paid job or find another one. There are a lot of good things about my job, and it has been good for me - especially given I've been able to hold down a full time job for a few years now despite mental health issues - but it's not well paid at all and low skilled, and the content frequently makes me depressed and anxious because so much of it is horrific (criminal law related.)\n\nI guess I just needed to vent, so thank you for reading this far. I am not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel at the moment, and it is a struggle to get through each day.

The past 10 days I have spent every day crying and wanting to die, thinking I deserve to die, thinking I should have died years ago.\n\nHow can I tell anyone except Reddit about this? You tell a professional and they immediately start assessing you for admission to hospital. (Worst experience of my life, public psych ward.) And you can't tell friends or family because they simply aren't equipped to handle it, or don't want to hear something so scary and sad. \n\nI thought I'd be over this level of depression by now. It has been five years since I've been this depressed.\n\nOn the bright side, I am still largely functioning. I might cry every day at work, but I am still making it to work and pushing through to stay there. I remember to brush my teeth. I don't remember to wash my hair or clothes as often as I should, and I have been isolating myself from everyone and everything. I sleep well most nights. I'm more or less managing, despite the persistent suicidal ideation.\n\nSo, goals. Goals are sometimes the only thing that keeps me from going through with any plans for suicide. I'm obese at the moment, so my first goal would be to get to 60kg, which is a healthy weight for my height. It's going to take a lot of extremely hard work to get there, but at least I can tell myself that I can only seriously consider suicide only when I've reached that goal weight. And it gives me time to get better. No one truly wants to suffer like this. \n\nIt gives me time to try other things and tactics that might mean reaching a stage of consistent contentment, because happiness is a fleeting emotion.\n\nThe second goal is to run an ultramarathon, at least 100kms. I ran a marathon several years ago, when I was a lot fitter and lighter and before the mental health issues truly kicked in, and it was the best thing I have ever done with my life. Sometimes I think that while running is the only time I am happy and can practice positive affirmations.\n\nI guess I just wanted to post here because I needed to tell someone how I was really feeling, someone who might understand that I wasn't necessarily going to kill myself right now but even just thinking about it is an excruciating sort of emotional pain.
