I was a virgin until I met him 9 months ago. Even so, it was hard to get into my sexuality because of my past. I was raped when I was 18 and I\u2019m still having a tough time getting over it. The first time he tried to have sex with me, I couldn\u2019t relax which made me tight and it hurt (I\u2019m petite and he\u2019s pretty big in both ways) and I got so frustrated with it all that I started to cry. \n\nIt took a few weeks and a bath together for me to finally relax and enjoy each other. However, most of the time I start to cry during sex. Sometimes its because I am overwhelmed with emotion. Sometimes it brings me back to when I was 18. Overall though, my problems were getting better and we had a more intimate and fun sex life. Sometimes we would do it 3 times in one day if I wished! Now it\u2019s getting worse. \n\nI started my college semester and the stress has been through the roof! I\u2019m finding it hard to get wet even if I\u2019m by myself wanting to have a little fun. Sometimes my boyfriend is forced to go away for weeks due to his job but every time we go long periods without sex, that anxiety comes back. I\u2019m not excited like I usually am, I get scared which makes having sex difficult. I love him so very much and he\u2019s been so patient and gentle with me. Neither of us are insecure about our bodies and I feel completely safe with him at all times. We communicate very openly but I just don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t get out of my head. What steps do I need to take to have a healthier relationship with sex?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "sex", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "subreddit_subscribers": 1048934, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sex with my boyfriend (21M) brings up tears and lots of emotions (20F).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9y51vi/sex_with_my_boyfriend_21m_brings_up_tears_and/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "abubblelala", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2l1xc0f2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542139081, "domain": "self.depression", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9wsho5/im_facing_the_consequences_of_the_poor_personal/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wsho5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/9wsho5/im_facing_the_consequences_of_the_poor_personal/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1542139082, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have been depressed and had anxiety since I was 12 but officially diagnosed and committed at 16. I\u2019m currently 20 years old. It all stems from a dysfunctional home life. My dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mom didn\u2019t know how to connect emotionally with me. I was very sensitive and cried all the time. It got worse during my school years. I was bullied and didn\u2019t have great friends yet I excelled in school and extracurricular to avoid negative interactions. \n\nHigh school I stopped trying. I stopped brushing my teeth, showering, doing my hair, bothering with my outfits, etc. hoping somehow I\u2019d die from my neglect.  I got diagnosed and have been trying to pick up the pieces ever since. I reverted back to these damaging behaviors my freshman and sophomore year of college. Now I\u2019m paying the price. I\u2019m borderline underweight, small appetite, and I\u2019ve needed so many root canals and fillings that my family is making fun of me. The guilt I have from this depression behavior is really affecting my ability to heal. I feel as if it\u2019s my fault I have these problems and so I fall into a depression and the behavior starts again. I feel as if I don\u2019t deserve to heal because I did this to myself. I have a boyfriend to live for and dreams I want to fulfill so I\u2019m desperately trying to get better. I cry because I feel like I cut my lifespan in half due to my neglect. Now I want to live a long healthy life.\n\nMy question is how do accept it and not beat myself up over what my Illness made me do to myself? I\u2019m tired of feeling like it solely is my fault (technically it is) when I\u2019ve been asking for help from my parents for so long.

My boyfriend is 21 and serves in the army. I\u2019m a junior in college. It\u2019s been 9 months so far. We met in January and we were so crazy about each other that we wanted to meet each other\u2019s family. So of course, I traveled with him to his home state in July and fell in love with his family and his hometown over a two week period . My family equally enjoyed him at Easter dinner. He\u2019s been away on missions for awhile so we decided it would be nice if we could travel again to his hometown for his Christmas leave. I told my mom and it didn\u2019t go so well. She got so very angry and said I should get to know him first and that it\u2019s only appropriate that I stay with my family for Christmas and he stay with his. The thing is he begged me to go. And we make each other so very happy. And my family is kinda toxic sometimes so I thought it would be a nice break.  But no, my mom was pissed and it really upset my boyfriend. She told me to go on my vacation and never come back home. I\u2019m heartbroken really. I\u2019ve always been a good daughter but I was really sheltered. But we both have such a genuine connection! My question is should I fight this? Or is my mom correct to keep me home for the holidays? She\u2019s not paying for it, and I only come home for holidays and breaks. I don\u2019t know how to cross the border into adulthood and dating because my family makes it hard. Thank you!
