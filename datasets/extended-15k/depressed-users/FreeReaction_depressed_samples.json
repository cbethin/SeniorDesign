I tried a couple medicines when I was younger but didn't give them much time to work before stopping them. I tried Cymbalta two years ago and think I had bad side effects and horrible withdrawal trying to get off.  I currently go to therapy once a week or once every two weeks but sometimes I feel like it's just not enough. I have a cycle of being happy and being sad. I feel like I could benefit from a medicine but having a bad reaction from my last medicine makes me hesitant. I am in my junior year of college and it can be hard to complete simple tasks or even leave my room. Also my therapist does not believe in prescribing antidepressants. \n\nWhat are your thoughts treating depression with medicine?\n\nPlease share if you have had success on antidepressants as well", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 405773, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Thoughts on treating depression with medication", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9x4siz/thoughts_on_treating_depression_with_medication/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
