my full set of reasons for why i want to kill myself.\n\nI am almost 27 years old and for me as it does im sure for many people who kill themselves it starts in school, i never had friends growing up, that wernt online anyway, a day at school for me was a day of torture. For the longest time i was bullied every day and unlike many kids i wasnt bullied and then had a few other bullied people who i made friends with, for me for whatever reason i decided the best thing i could do was avoid contact with anyone my age at all costs. School for me didnt really change from grade 1 to 12, i went to school avoided other kids at all costs and went home and played either with my dog or video games. I did say i had some friends online and they were amazing, it was the small bit of companionship i got sadly though as we have aged they have moved on from being able to game with me to having families and careers, sad for me anyway good for them. Threw school i was suicidal quite a bit, never attempted but thought about it daily everynight lying in bed i would think why go threw that next day, why suffer threw a day of misery for what coming home to play video games, sure i love video games but it didnt seem worth going threw the days of torture at school. But i struggled threw it i read a bunch online about suicde and people said just wait it will get better after school.\n\nSure its better in the sence im not getting bullied everyday now but now its just nothing, I am a failure when it comes to pretty much every aspect of life, career nothing, i am lazy by nature i have been fired from several jobs because i must say i just dont care, I dont know how people do it, care i mean for work, i go to work and i do the bare minimum to get my pay cheque so i can survive to the next one. Nothing as far as a career gets me excited, maybe a few things in science area's but i have learning disabilites that make studying and passing tests just impossible, it took me 5 tries to get my drivers licence and that was $50 or something down the shitter everytime i failed, im not willing to try something i would almost certainly drop out of to be in debt 20 or 30 thousand dollars. Right now i am unemployed which is what i prefer when i can, but i am running low on money and soon will have to take that next dead end job and we will see how long that one lasts.\n\nAnother is the fact i never have or ever will have a relationship, i am 27 years old and have never been on a date or really even talked to a girl, but for that matter i dont even think i am attracted to women. I have never really felt sexual attraction for a man or women and that just makes me even more sad, i would prefer to be gay then asexual at least then i would have the chance for a relationship instead it just reinforces the fact i will be alone forever. The only compainonship i have ever had outside of my online friends were the few dogs i have had i really loved them but i have not been able to own a dog in a very long time considering i am only ever able to rent and next to no rentals allow dogs.\n\nI have always just thought of Suicide as a wonderful escape, it will set me free, I am an atheist so i beieve when i die it will fade to black and i will never experience anything again which sounds wonderful to me. The only reason i have never gone threw with it is my parents, i do love them and i dont want to make them suffer but it is at the point where i am going to just have to do it and try and leave a note to explain that this was the only way for me to truly find some happyness, or at least end the unhappyness.\n\nThank you for Reading", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "offmychest", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "subreddit_subscribers": 749874, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I am about to kill myself", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9xzsnc/i_am_about_to_kill_myself/", "whitelist_status": "house_only", "wls": 1}, {"author": "Unchainedboar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e54c4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542411079, "domain": "self.confession", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9xrfa0/i_am_about_to_kill_myself/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9xrfa0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/confession/comments/9xrfa0/i_am_about_to_kill_myself/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1542411080, "score": 1, "selftext": "Adam Hill, Why i am going to kill Myself\n\nI have written down why i feel suicidal before but usually in small amounts and never the full story, here i will try to lay out my full set of reasons for why i want to kill myself.\n\nI am almost 27 years old and for me as it does im sure for many people who kill themselves it starts in school, i never had friends growing up, that wernt online anyway, a day at school for me was a day of torture.

Threw school i was suicidal quite a bit, never attempted but thought about it daily everynight lying in bed i would think why go threw that next day, why suffer threw a day of misery for what coming home to play video games, sure i love video games but it didnt seem worth going threw the days of torture at school. But i struggled threw it i read a bunch online about suicde and people said just wait it will get better after school.\n\nSure its better in the sence im not getting bullied everyday now but now its just nothing, I am a failure when it comes to pretty much every aspect of life, career nothing, i am lazy by nature i have been fired from several jobs because i must say i just dont care, I dont know how people do it, care i mean for work, i go to work and i do the bare minimum to get my pay cheque so i can survive to the next one. Nothing as far as a career gets me excited, maybe a few things in science area's but i have learning disabilites that make studying and passing tests just impossible, it took me 5 tries to get my drivers licence and that was $50 or something down the shitter everytime i failed, im not willing to try something i would almost certainly drop out of to be in debt 20 or 30 thousand dollars. Right now i am unemployed which is what i prefer when i can, but i am running low on money and soon will have to take that next dead end job and we will see how long that one lasts.\n\nAnother is the fact i never have or ever will have a relationship, i am 27 years old and have never been on a date or really even talked to a girl, but for that matter i dont even think i am attracted to women. I have never really felt sexual attraction for a man or women and that just makes me even more sad, i would prefer to be gay then asexual at least then i would have the chance for a relationship instead it just reinforces the fact i will be alone forever. The only compainonship i have ever had outside of my online friends were the few dogs i have had i really loved them but i have not been able to own a dog in a very long time considering i am only ever able to rent and next to no rentals allow dogs.\n\nI have always just thought of Suicide as a wonderful escape, it will set me free, I am an atheist so i beieve when i die it will fade to black and i will never experience anything again which sounds wonderful to me.\nThe only reason i have never gone threw with it is my parents, i do love them and i dont want to make them suffer but it is getting to the point where i am going to just have to do it and try and leave a not to explain that this was the only way for me to truly find some happyness, or at least end the unhappyness.\n\nThank you for Reading ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 405176, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Darkest Hour", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9wm3rc/my_darkest_hour/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "Unchainedboar", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "modmsg", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e54c4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542085841, "domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9wm3od/my_darkest_hour/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wm3od", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9wm3od/my_darkest_hour/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1542085842, "score": 1, "selftext": "Adam Hill, Why i want to kill myself\t\n\nI have written down why i feel suicidal before but usually in small amounts and never the full story, here i will try to lay out my full set of reasons for why i want to kill myself.\n\nI am almost 27 years old and for me as it does im sure for many people who kill themselves it starts in school, i never had friends growing up, that wernt online anyway, a day at school for me was a day of torture.

made for a completely different kind of demographic then the kind like me that loved Classic/BC the most\n\nBut i held out hope that Diablo might keep me a Blizz fan\n\nDiablo 3 for all its faults at launch started to be pretty fun with Reaper of Souls, not D2 lvl but still fun, but im done with it at this point, the seasons and classes no longer interest me. I really held out hope for a D2 remaster, i was quite confident it was not going to be D4.\n\nAnd to be Honest i am very worried that D4 when it comes out will just be the BFA of Diablo, dont expect something hardcore that caters to true D2 fans, expect something that is more casual then D3, tell me im wrong, tell me you dont think modern day Blizzard wont make D4 casual as !@#$.\n\nAnyway its a very sad day as someone who has been a long time fan of Diablo and Blizzard i think the company has finally fallen to the side of EA\n\nEA/Blizzard, whats the difference at this point?",

completely alone now, i used to have a dog that gave me some sense of companionship but she is gone and i cant get another one.\nI am asexual a virgin never been on a date in my life never will since i am not interested in men or women, I live with my mother we dont get along, we basically share no interests what so ever so if she ever talks to me its to tell me to do something or when she gets drunk its to yell at me, which happens quite a bit.\nI have nothing at all as far as career prospects go no education besides high school, and i have severe test anxiety i tried to take an EMR once which is Emergency Medical Responder i studied was doing well in the day to day classes i got to the mid term of sorts froze and flunked out wasting $2000\nI feel so alone and i cant stop crying, i want the pain to end and i dont feel like this will ever change, i hear the BS that it will but i dont see how, i have been in the pain for years and death would be a relief that i feel i deserve.",

i can remember. It all started in school as a kid i was an awkward child in a small town, where you grow a reputation quickly, i was quickly known as the kid to stay away from if you want to be popular. I made my peace with it i thought maybe in high school i would have another chance, I quickly found out that wasnt the case, i got bullied like crazy in high school to the point that i really started considering it for the first time. I found out how to tie a noose and i found some rope in my dads workshop and tied one and kept it in my room and for long periods of time i would just look at it considering. I ended up not doing it thinking to myself, It must get better once school is over, that is what everyone keeps telling me they cant be lying right one day its going to get better. Then school ended with me never really having a friend in my life outside of my dog, never once having a sleep over or going to another kids house but i made it threw high school. Ontop of all that BS with just being a lonely piece of shit i have always been a failure when it comes to any kind of academics or skills that would lead to some kind of career, I am 25 years old and have never made over 10k a year, no kind of post secondary and no prospects to speak of what so ever. Still living with my mother and she wants me out more and more with each passing month, nothing saved to speak of, at this point i have moved on from the noose and i think about a cliff near my house and have decided when i do it it will be there as i imagine it being the least painful.

for it i have got 3 jobs each one lasting less then 10 weeks because of a lack of work lay off, and then i have talked to 50+ people who just tell me, \"we arnt hiring year 1's\"\n\nit just makes me feel so fucking hopeless, no friends no career and on top of all that i am a Asexual i am not attracted to men or women, just another thing that makes me feel like i will be alone forever\n\ni have a job right now, i mow lawns and its fine but its not like i could ever move out and make a living doing it, all day every day i imagine different ways to kill myself, what i would put in my suicide note, and how wonderfull it would be if the pain stopped.\n\ni just want it over.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "offmychest", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ranw", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have been

I was an annoying child unable to hold onto friends i drove people away with my annoying personality, i fully accept that it was my fault that i didnt have friends, but i felt lonely. I always had my dog though her name was Lady, and she was awesome she kept me going because i knew i had a friend of some kind to come home to after a shitty day at school, that and my friends on World of Warcraft, they were the only friends i really had. I was very suicidal threw out all of high school I was very unpopular I had no friends at all I literally went to school avoided kids at every opportunity to avoid bullying but the worst part is I was unpopular but I wasn't smart either it seems like most kids in my situation at least had good grades and a bright future to look forward to but I was dumb and unpopular, I kept going because I thought one day it might get better One of the worst things that was a major mistake was i got a dog of my own, her name was Ari she is a German Shepherd and i had her for 1 year, i got her well living with my mom, my mother sold her house and i had to find a new place to stay, i had a place with Ari for a while but i got layed off (as every decent job i have ever got) and i couldnt afford the place i was renting anymore, i ended up having to move back in with my mother, for the 4th or 5th time... and the town house my mother was renting didnt allow dogs, so i had to do the hardest thing of my life and give my dog away, it has been over 16 months since i gave her away and i still think about her everyday, she was the only real friend i had. I loved her and now i am more alone then ever. Sadly i have started to even lose those World of Warcraft friends, they grew up have families now, relationships and dont have time for silly video games anymore, so loneliness is deffinitly one of the major contributers to me being suicidal. I would say the biggest contributer to me wanting to die is the fact that i feel like i will never accomplish anything of note in my life, i have no self confidence to speak of what so ever, and i have always been horrible at any kind of academics, i cannot study or write tests, when i try to study i take in words for about 1-2 pages or 5-10 minutes and then it turns to a blur and i take in nothing.

I was an annoying child unable to hold onto friends i drove people away with my annoying personality, i fully accept that it was my fault that i didnt have friends, but i felt lonely. I always had my dog though her name was Lady, and she was awesome she kept me going because i knew i had a friend of some kind to come home to after a shitty day at school, that and my friends on World of Warcraft, they were the only friends i really had.\n\nOne of the worst things that was a major mistake was i got a dog of my own, her name was Ari she is a German Shepherd and i had her for 1 year, i got her well living with my mom, my mother sold her house and i had to find a new place to stay, i had a place with Ari for a while but i got layed off (as every decent job i have ever got) and i couldnt afford the place i was renting anymore, i ended up having to move back in with my mother, for the 4th or 5th time... and the town house my mother was renting didnt allow dogs, so i had to do the hardest thing of my life and give my dog away, it has been over 16 months since i gave her away and i still think about her everyday, she was the only real friend i had. I loved her and now i am more alone then ever.\n\nSadly i have started to even lose those World of Warcraft friends, they grew up have families now, relationships and dont have time for silly video games anymore, so loneliness is deffinitly one of the major contributers to me being suicidal.\n\nI would say the biggest contributer to me wanting to die is the fact that i feel like i will never accomplish anything of note in my life, i have no self confidence to speak of what so ever, and i have always been horrible at any kind of academics, i cannot study or write tests, when i try to study i take in words for about 1-2 pages or 5-10 minutes and then it turns to a blur and i take in nothing.\n\nIt took my 5 tries to pass my drivers test and people tell me \"thats great see you persisted and you did it!\"\n\nand thats great but anything important in life costs alot of money, i cant afford to take a university course and fail it 4 times hoping one of these times i will pass, basically the only thing i have going for me in life is i am not in crippling debt.\n\nI wish i could get out of my Mothers house, i know she is sick of me still being here, she talks all the time about how she should get a minute to herself and all that, and i agree i am pathetic to still be here i want out so bad but i am a fucking mess of a human being, i want this existence over i want it to fade to

i have no one to talk to, my mother has a drinking problem, she is responsible i she works very hard and is a manager at a store but i have tried to talk to her about my problems and she always tells

So now I am on my way back to penticton a small town to my mother and op top of that I think my mom really doesn't want me back either, she is sick of having me stay with her, which I understand as I am increadibly unlikable. Not that it mattered as I ended up getting kicked out because they were not allowed to have extended guests so their landlord gave me the boot. So on top of all that I have no friends, never have I was the loser in high school never had a sleep over at another kids house i don't think I ever even went to another kids house in high school. So with that being said I obviously never had a girl friend, I am 23 and a virgin which I really don't care about but I want a gf I want someone to care about, someone who cares about me, the truth is I don't even know if I am interested in girls I have never had the opportunity to try... I feel like such a mess as I didn't get the experience that other people do in high school. There was a time fairly recently when I was happy, I had a dog, her name was Ari she was a German Shepard and I loved her win all my heart, she was that companion that loved me unconditionally and I could always spend time with, but i ended up having to give her away. The place I was staying that I could keep her at, I ended up having to move out of and was not able to find another pet friendly place that I could afford, I gave her to a good family with children but I still think about her endlessly and it's been like 8 months now. I find myself wishing I never got her as I was a lot better depression wise before I got her then I am now. In closing I know I am severely depressed I have been for 10-15 years and I want it to end but every time and I mean every time I think there is a chance for it to get better it all goes wrong and I am sick of trying.. it seems like it keeps only getting worse and worse, and it never gets better, people tell me it will get better but you dont know that for all anyone knows it will just keep getting worse and stay that way... i just want to die, i dont want to try anymore, i keep trying to find a job to do something meaningful with my life, but no i got no friends im going to end up at

So now I am on my way back to penticton a small town to my mother and op top of that I think my mom really doesn't want me back either, she is sick of having me stay with her, which I understand as I am increadibly unlikable. Not that it mattered as I ended up getting kicked out because they were not allowed to have extended guests so their landlord gave me the boot.\n\nSo on top of all that I have no friends, never have I was the loser in high school never had a sleep over at another kids house i don't think I ever even went to another kids house in high school. So with that being said I obviously never had a girl friend, I am 23 and a virgin which I really don't care about but I want a gf I want someone to care about, someone who cares about me, the truth is I don't even know if I am interested in girls I have never had the opportunity to try... I feel like such a mess as I didn't get the experience that other people do in high school.\n\nThere was a time fairly recently when I was happy, I had a dog, her name was Ari she was a German Shepard and I loved her win all my heart, she was that companion that loved me unconditionally and I could always spend time with, but i ended up having to give her away. The place I was staying that I could keep her at, I ended up having to move out of and was not able to find another pet friendly place that I could afford, I gave her to a good family with children but I still think about her endlessly and it's been like 8 months now. I find myself wishing I never got her as I was a lot better depression wise before I got her then I am now.\n\nIn closing I know I am severely depressed I have been for 10-15 years and I want it to end but every time and I mean every time I think there is a chance for it to get better it all goes wrong and I am sick of trying...", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The only reason I keep going is not to hurt family", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3blo04/the_only_reason_i_keep_going_is_not_to_hurt_family/"}, {"author": "Unchainedboar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1435276797, "domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3b4uvj/back_to_my_small_town/", "id": "3b4uvj", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3b4uvj/back_to_my_small_town/", "retrieved_on": 1440648351, "score": 8, "selftext": "So i moved to Vancouver to move in with my cousin and his girlfriend to try and get something going in the crap BS life of mine, im 23 and i have done nothing at all there is nothing to mention about me, i moved here and got a job for a little while and i singed up for school, was going to take Game development&design it was going to start on July 6th, when a few days ago we got a letter saying that my cousin has had a guest for over 2 consecutive weeks and has to leave within 30 days.
