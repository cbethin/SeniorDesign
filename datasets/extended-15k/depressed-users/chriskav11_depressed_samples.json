I don\u2019t want talked out of killing myself I just wish there was a way of doing it and not hurting my family. My brother has tried to commit suicide and ive seen the effects of this on my parents they\u2019ve both completely changed. There is no happiness in this house anymore. Ever. Because of my brother, I really feel like i cant talk to them about any of it because it would ruin them and theyd blame themselves. I just want it to be over. I thought I was okay for a while then tonight I was walking my dog and just broke down in tears and ran back and now lying in bed looking at pain-free ways to die and i am too big a pussy to go through with it. In the past 5 years:\n\n- parents nearly split up\n- girlfriend cheated on me\n- brother tried to commit suicide\n- brother quit his job and uses heroin\n- i got diagnosed with a rare genetic disease \n\nI guess my main question is:\n\nIf someone wants to take there life isn\u2019t that their right? Without all the stigma. The world is already overpopulated and should only be filled with those that appreciate it a lot more than i do. \n\nSorry to anyone reading this", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 398352, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can\u2019t get out of this hole.
