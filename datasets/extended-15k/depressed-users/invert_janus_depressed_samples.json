I acknowledge my mistakes I know it\u2019s horrible that I\u2019ve done nothing for my future since graduating high school. I\u2019ve suffered from depression in secret since age 7 and started having suicidal thoughts around age 12-present. My family still doesn\u2019t know but has continued to support me.\n\nRecently I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that I will have for the rest of my life. It requires constant doctors visits and management, lots of medication and my family is already struggling to keep our house. Needless to say the situation is bad and I desperately need a job but my depression and severe anxiety has prevented me from even looking. I know it\u2019s quite pathetic and there is no excuse for my lack of action. But with the already thousands of dollars in medical bills I have to face this.\n\nI\u2019m terrified of going into an interview and them asking \u201cso what have you done the past 5 years\u201d and not having an answer to their questions. Any information about how to prepare, what kinds of questions can be asked can be helpful. And any advice on how to deal with anxiety when it comes to these things would be appreciated. I don\u2019t have any major skills aside from things like photoshop but most jobs I\u2019ll apply for probably won\u2019t require that. I\u2019ll do anything.\n\nThanks to anyone who is willing to help or give me any reassurance. I fear I\u2019ll never be able to be hired. I literally feel like the worst person in existence I really just want to be able to finally help and contribute to my family.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 404272, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "23.
