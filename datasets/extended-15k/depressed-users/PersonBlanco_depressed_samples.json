Up until last year I didn\u2019t do anything outside of what I had to. Last year was senior year of high school. I joined the marching band and felt the best that I\u2019ve ever felt in a really long time. I didn\u2019t have a single minute of free time and I loved it. Going into college I tried out for drumline and didn\u2019t get in, which was a bummer but I wasn\u2019t too psyched about it and ended up not practicing enough. I\u2019m 18 now and been having serious doubts about continuing my education despite it being \u201cgood\u201d for me. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t have a reason to get a higher education. I have a steady job delivering pizzas, so I\u2019m not inclined to find a high paying job, I\u2019m doing alright. I\u2019m not inclined to do what I love, because it seems like I jump interest to interest too often. I cant just sit down and really get into something.\n\nFrom when I was little it seems like I only did things for my parent\u2019s approval, so I\u2019ve been trying to fight against that in recent years; trying to move out, work as much as I can to pay for myself, become independent. Now I am hearing about stories from my parents about how they were terribly depressed in their first year of college, and that it\u2019ll get better and that I\u2019ve just gotta put myself out there. Hearing this just makes me feel worse. I feel like my emotions arent important because everyone going into college is going to feel somewhat depressed. I don\u2019t care enough about any of the things that I like, music, arts, etc, to see myself majoring in them. I\u2019m aware there are plenty of options for me to pursue, but I just don\u2019t care enough to do them. I don\u2019t care if I miss opportunities at this point of my life. \n\nHearing that my mom was depressed all throughout her first year of college, I assume everyone feels homesick, questioning their place in the world, and simply get sad at times. I just don\u2019t care. It makes it worse that my parents DO care. I don\u2019t know why, it just does. And I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m good enough at my hobbies/talents to make it anywhere. \n\nI just brought up the idea of wanting to be an accountant to my mom, so I can have stability and ease in the future. 90% of what she was saying was \u201cI don\u2019t want you to miss out on the opportunities you have.\u201d A whole 10 minutes about me giving up and not even trying, and the cherry on top: \u201cbut you can be an accountant too.\u201d Why does this matter so much to me? Why do I only care about what she says? Why am I even writing this long ass paragraph to put online? My supportive parents seem like a privilege, and a reason not to seek help. I have all the help I need right here, but why does it hurt every time I come here and talk to them about anything in my life? Why can\u2019t I just be on my own? What\u2019s stopping me from moving far away? What\u2019s stopping me from moving to the next chapter in my life? I need help, but don\u2019t care enough to seek it out.
