Like they know that there\u2019s also good in me but they only acknowledge it a little, kind of like brushing it off, \u201coh yeah there\u2019s these good qualities in you but you still lack in here and here and there. You should work on these, you should be more like this and that\u201d they emphasized on my flaws and weaknesses more. They also only seems to praise me my good qualities if they want something from it, \u201c I know you\u2019re good at this and that right? Then you should do this for me, you **must** do it because you\u2019re good at it\u201d\n\nI also feel very misunderstood and alienated. Other people can understand me better and not sees my words to the worst yet my family and sibling did. They assume the worst from what I said or did, completely misunderstood my intention, but won\u2019t ask nor let me explain. They hear but does not listen. They look but does not see. I think it\u2019s not even exaggerating if I said they see me as the monster in the family.\n\nI feel tremendously hurt when knowing that my mom prefer and love my sibling more than me and I know this is a fact since a while ago I saw her chatting with my sister differently than with me. She\u2019s being a loving mother to my sister and even called her \u2018dear\u2019 and \u2018sweetie\u2019 and she never does that to me. Let alone chatting, she barely even talk to me. I somehow feel like the black goat and \u2018the child who brings unfortunate in the family\u2019 kind of child. I feel unloved yet when I bring this up to her, she yelled at me saying I\u2019m an ungrateful child and what more can I possibly want that she had done her best for me. I don\u2019t know if she said the truth but I don\u2019t like the fact that she act differently between me and my sister.\n\nMy sister also somehow the same, but she was being two-faced about it. We was never that close to begin with, because even as a child I can already feel the golden child behavior my parents give her and it made me jealous so I avoid her as I was annoyed. But growing up I pretend like I was blind towards all that just so I could get better and closer towards my family. I mean, they\u2019re still my family after all. So in the recent years, I\u2019ve been pretty close to my sister, or at least I thought we were, until I found out that she has been bad mouthing me behind my back in front of her friends. She degrade me, pointing out only the worst in me, reveal all my flaws and weaknesses and then talk like she never needed me in the first place until her friends also see me in the worst light and start bad mouthing and belittle me too.\n\nBoth of my mom and my sister also said that I played the victim and have little to no self-instrospections when I tried to explain myself and this what makes me hurting the most and questioning everything. It also what makes me feel the most misunderstood because I don\u2019t feel like I played the victim and I try my best to change to a better me but why did they said that? Am I *really* playing the victim and keep denying it? Am I not a better person than I was yet keep trying to convince myself otherwise? With all the fact that they only sees the worst it me, it\u2019s no shocking that they see me this way. But what if, I really *did* play the victim and I really am not changing? And I still keep questioning myself to this day.\n\nThey also told me that I\u2019m being too sensitive and emotional when I told them their words and actions hurts me. Being a HSP and also INFP, being called that is like a one-two punch without me ever being able to defend myself. Everything I said afterwards will just prove them right. It shuts me up without a chance to fix the source problems.\n\nThe irony about all this is that my friends never sees me this way. They told me they\u2019re grateful I\u2019m always there for them, always intently listening to them, give them the support they need and always ready to lent a hand when they needed most.
