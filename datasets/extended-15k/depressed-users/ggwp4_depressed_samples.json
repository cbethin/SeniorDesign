And (for me at least) it seems very complex because I want the database for the user\u2019s business to function along different platforms. For example, having the \u201ccenter of command\u201d on the desktop where all functions can be performed and supplemental (mobile) apps (that function as user portals) that have limited functions for clients and employees, but all containing the same information, just limited access on for the employees and clients if that makes sense.\n\nSo some key functions so maybe you guys can get an idea of what I\u2019m trying to piece together:\n\nWeb based application for desktop and mobile. Generally a management software. POS, appt book, clock in/out, employee management, stats, marketing, that kind of general stuff. What I wanted to do differently was have a mobile app for client portals to make appointments, see history, promotions, push notifications, that sort of thing.

I know you all might need the entire big picture but I cannot sit here for three hours writing this post that no one will end up reading. \n\nThis won\u2019t be that long but I still have a TLDR at the end. \n\nBasically here: I have curly 3b hair. It doesn\u2019t stay curled after it dries no matter what the fuck I do. The roots are always matted. Always. Always. Always. And stiff. The only time they get reduced to \u201ctangles\u201d is when I brush it dry, but who brushes curly hair dry? If I brush my hair to lay on my head and then flip my hair over to scrunch it, my roots will stay on my scalp. Shit doesn\u2019t move. And then the more i move my hair when it\u2019s wet, the more it mats, like I can turn my head and thats a problem. My hair clumps, is stiff, and brittle, and feels dry. It looks frizzy when wet even after smoothing it out with a comb or brush (sometimes a comb can\u2019t detangle my hair. I suspected a protein overload so I made product adjustments. My hair fall is fucking ridiculous and even after trying to detangle my hair for an hour I just have to stop and give up and let it be matted because my hair wont stop falling out. At one point it was like almost entire locks of hair coming out. My scalp doesnt look bald, but my the length of my hair looks like one of those beaded curtains. \n\nI don\u2019t have money for a hair cut, and I don\u2019t have money for expensive products, or wigs unfortunately (for my shaving solution). But this is really bothering me. I have to condition it every other day just because the matting gets really bad and if I leave it for once a week it gets too bad. \n\nTLDR;\n\nMy hair mats, not tangles, MATS, at the roots, likely due to my hair being incredibly stiff, brittle, and clumping (in stiff clumps). I usually have to give up trying to detangle it every time I try and let it be. Won\u2019t curl either because of how stiff it is. My hair fall is insane and my hair is thin, but not balding, but still shockingly thin. It\u2019s 3b curls, and porous. Tried many many many things and it\u2019s not getting better and just continuing to thin a lot. \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "HaircareScience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2y8kx", "subreddit_subscribers": 48849, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My hair is so horrific, I\u2019m one melt down away from shaving it all off.

By the time I got to 19 it thinned out quite a bit but it started to shrink less and keep the length instead of shrinking into a fro. \n\nTwo years ago I had a decent amount of hair (but still noticeably less than my teenage years from my POV) down to my waist. I cut it, donated it as it was virgin and healthy, and then had shoulder length hair. \n\nA year after the cut (Dec 2017) I dyed it red with box dye, three times, a few months apart. \n\nCURRENTLY:\n\nI have about 2in of new growth. I was super depressed and stressed for an entire year (8/17-now 9/18). I only took anti depressants for a few weeks on and off, but for the majority of the time I wasn\u2019t on medication (nor vitamins, but I never took vitamins). Its actually been like that for the past 6 years because depression isn\u2019t new. My health didn\u2019t change, eating habits, sleeping habits, etc. \n\nI stopped taking care if my hair after dying it, then maybe like two months I started too and cracked down on the coconut oil treatments. (Virgin organic coconut oil, shea moisture coconut line, &amp; cantu shea leave in, with the cantu being something I have used for years). My hair was VERY matted prior to this from the neglect, and then became so stiff, easily knotted , brittle and rough. And the hair loss...my hair was practically coming out in locks of hair, and even after detangling it my hair wouldn\u2019t stop coming out. I could roll it up into a ball the size of a ping pong ball, CONDENSED. And that was me detangling it every other day for about 3 detangling sessions. \n\nI figure its protein over load. So I pre-pooed with some water, aloe vera gel, honey, olive oil, and suave clarifying conditioner to get most of the tangles out. Then used clarifying shampoo from root to tip, used apple cider rinse, then aussie moisture conditioner &amp; then their 3 minute miracle deep conditioner with aloe vera. \n\nThe roughness actually went away in the first shower and my hair can hold a decent curl pattern without frizzing up terribly. I\u2019m still losing more hair than I\u2019d like, but its DEFINITELY not as much as before. \n\nMy hair line isnt wide, but the length of my hair has lost thickness and thin/sparse looking. My family has A LOT of hair and balding isn\u2019t a thing so its definitely not genetic. \n\nMY QUESTION FOR YOU:\nI\u2019m just going to cut my hair very short (slightly above my shoulders) to grow out the dyed portion, but is there something I can do to thicken my hair? MORE IMPORTANTLY, is that even possible? Castor oil? Biotin? Anything?????\n\nTLDR:\n\nI used to have pretty thick hair, went through a severe period of depression and constant stress, neglected my hair, then tried to fix it months after neglect only to overload it with protein, hair started to fall out nearly in chunks every detangle session which was every other day, clarified and deep conditioned with aussie moisture, kind of feels better now, BUT IS SO THIN AND SPARSE.

He\u2019s CONSTANTLY doing things he shouldn\u2019t be doing and EVEN MORE CONSTANTLY touching things he shouldn\u2019t. I will try my best to play with him, (usually consists of me sitting with him as he plays), I sit him on my lap a lot and bounce him around or pick him up and carry him around, and I feed him too (my favorite). \n\nI feel like I could be more playful but I don\u2019t know how.

I usually just shout his name and he stops but then throws this whiny tantrum, which I feel bad about because he\u2019s not my kid. I especially feel bad on days where I work over time and don\u2019t have the energy to be \u201csweet\u201d/loving with him and I usually just acknowledge him if he needs/wants something or does something wrong. \n\nI don\u2019t really know where the line is.
