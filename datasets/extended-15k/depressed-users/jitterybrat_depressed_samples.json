He told me I was the first person he ever cried in front of and I thought that was kind of endearing in a way so I comforted him until he felt better and we made up. He\u2019d kinda bring this up a few times after to make me feel like I was important or something? I dunno. I remember that night I asked him how hasn\u2019t he cried to his ex? She was horrible to him and he said he has cried over her but never in front of her. Now today, I scrolled way back in our text photos because I was looking for a drawing from our early stages. It was special. I stumbled upon a slew of screenshots of him fighting with his ex. I remembered that. When we were just friends, I helped him get over her. I was kinda disheartened seeing as how he was so sweet to her when he was mad but mean to me even though I\u2019m nice and she *really* wasn\u2019t. I kept on reading and there was a text where he said \u201cI literally cried to you about that!\u201d And that made me remember what he told me about crying... I know it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal but I can\u2019t help but wonder why he\u2019d lie about this? Should I question him? He knows I had an ex who was a pathological liar and he\u2019d lie about big things, make up big fake stories but also really small things that he had absolutely no reason to lie about. This worries me. \n\nTL;DR: Caught my boyfriend in a small lie and he knows I had a pathological liar ex who really damaged me. Wondering if I should question him or not.

It\u2019s like soul crushing to think about. \n\nIn the beginning, you were so incredibly sweet to me and made my heart flutter. I feel like that was just infatuation since it\u2019s moved so quickly and since it has seemed to fade. To be honest, I kinda knew that even back then but I didn\u2019t care, I jumped in because you made me feel so good, it was addicting. \n\nI still try to keep that magic around, I write you love letters (which is a real important thing to me), I give you massages, give you head, always do something special on the 23rd of each month even if its as small as getting you a card. You didn\u2019t do anything. You didn\u2019t have to spend any money but if you at least acknowledged it, that would\u2019ve been nice. The first month was perfect. I love what you made me. But if you didn\u2019t want us to do monthly things because it\u2019s too much of a hassle, you shouldn\u2019t have set the bar so high that first month. \n\nYou essentially love bombed me at the very beginning and then took that away once you got comfortable. I know the honeymoon phase fades but this is beyond that. \n\nAlso, I show you off. A LOT. I\u2019m in love with you, you\u2019re handsome, I think we look great together. Why wouldn\u2019t I? If you\u2019d look at my instagram, its flooded with pictures and videos of us. Pictures which I\u2019ve since had to delete because I felt awkward and desperate being the only one doing that kinda stuff. I\u2019ll see guys posting tons of pictures of their girlfriends and get jealous about it. I know it sounds petty, ridiculous and small. But those are my feelings and they are valid. Since you don\u2019t do that, the girls I\u2019m not too quite fond of don\u2019t even know I exist. I know I\u2019m better than that. I\u2019m tired of feeling insecure knowing theres someone out there who would treat me like a princess. \n\nYou used to, besides the picture thing. You used to make me feel special. Sending me long texts or leaving notes in places you know I\u2019d find eventually, all contributed to my love for you. When that stops, it makes me feel under appreciated. You started to write me a book and only got through 2 pages when some girl you never met who treated you like shit gets a whole trilogy. I just wish you still chased me even though you know I\u2019m always here. If I was a man, I\u2019d open doors for my girl and get her flowers when shes upset. Little shit like that amounts to a lot. And you know I\u2019ve been depressed as fuck lately but you haven\u2019t done one thing to comfort me. \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to put me first anymore and I\u2019ve expressed this countless times to you. I need to be put first, I don\u2019t want to settle for less anymore. You promised to cut down on your weed but continued to smoke every single day. I can\u2019t think of any reason you would continue to do something that you know makes me upset other than you not caring. I shouldn\u2019t have held on so tightly to that bullshit you told me in the beginning. \n\nYou even place my cat secondary when I was taking care of yours every day while you were at work. You know he\u2019s like my son and when you belittle him, you belittle me. \n\nYou\u2019re a self proclaimed narcissist and that makes you more likely to cheat. That and your blatant views on infidelity when I was talking about my parents. Childhood trauma which you belittled, by the way. Not only is the possibility of cheating an issue but I don\u2019t feel the desire to compliment you since you said \u201cI know\u201d when I called you hot. Do you think that\u2019s attractive? \n\nI want you to share your feelings with me and be comfortable opening up. Some mental stuff you simply can\u2019t fix all that easy. But I believe an over inflated ego derives from immaturity and it\u2019s something you CAN change. I\u2019ve learned to be more humble. Anyone can. I dealt with narcissists all the time in the city and it\u2019s about the most annoying shit in the world and that\u2019s what made me want to be less of a shitty person. It\u2019s like kim jong un trying to convince a country that he doesn\u2019t shit. No, everyone shits, everyone\u2019s human. No living person on this earth is a fucking god and they shouldn\u2019t act like it regardless of anything. I think I\u2019m smarter than most people my age, but I can acknowledge the fact that I\u2019m not a fucking genius. And you correcting me constantly even when you\u2019re wrong doesn\u2019t make you seem more intelligent it just makes you seem far up your ass. I feel like I can\u2019t get any point across without you saying \u201cwell, actually...\u201d it\u2019s just annoying. Like some of your \u201cfacts\u201d on psychology are incredibly wrong and you contradict yourself a lot but it\u2019s exhausting to argue. It\u2019s especially exhausting when you attempt to prove me wrong in a field you know I want to pursue. It just makes me feel like you don\u2019t believe in me. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly how Adrian made me feel with my book since he never cared to read it. I think I\u2019m interesting and have a lot to share and if someone doesn\u2019t want me to, fine, I\u2019ll take my shit elsewhere. \n\nYou\u2019ve expressed your distaste towards my hair, my tattoos, my piercings. And that\u2019s the only thing I wanna say fuck you for. My own boyfriend hates the very things that people compliment me on the most and 3 of the few aspects of my appearance I have control over. You want a pothead with perfectly clear skin free of art you view as \u201cflaws\u201d and long flowing hair who will deal with you missing other women and having an unrealistically inflated view of yourself? Well good luck finding that because I\u2019m finally done feeling unappreciated. I wish we could have met later. When you were more mature and realistic. You can keep my xbox, I hope that makes up for the pet fee you wouldn\u2019t stop complaining about.

I\u2019ve found that I don\u2019t enjoy it as much if I\u2019ve gotten off to porn that day. Way more enjoyable if I go a week without it a vibrator or something.

I never asked him to, he wanted to so that he could better remember me. Then he started smoking occasionally which bugged me a bit (and he knew) since he promised me and made a HUGE deal out of it. Now it\u2019s every single day. Every second spent with him, he\u2019s stoned. I don\u2019t smoke. I used to every day for about a year straight and looking back, I don\u2019t remember that year very well. Only small bits and pieces but they\u2019re fuzzy. I\u2019ll occasionally smoke with him but I don\u2019t enjoy it. I just hope for a sober day with him but it never happens so when he smokes, I feel kinda detached. He knows this but the conversations about it didn\u2019t seem to go anywhere. Finally, 2 days ago he said it was getting annoying so I decided to shut the fuck up. I wasn\u2019t nagging him. I didn\u2019t even wanna talk about why I was upset because I felt like I was bringing it up too often but he drilled me to talk to him. He broke a promise, I lost trust. It hurts. \n\nSecond, the female friends. His friends are exclusively women. Always have been. I only have an issue with the ones he\u2019s had a past with. One of them is his ex, another one\u2019s a porn star he used to be \u201cin love\u201d with, another one is a really pretty girl he had a crush on but she friendzoned him but she continuously flirts with him. Another one is this girl I helped him get over when we first met. He was crazy about her for 3 years and wrote her 3 books of poems. I never told him not to talk to friends but he himself insisted and then went back on it, just like the weed thing. This hurts too. It\u2019s fair for him to talk to his exes but not for me to talk to mine because he thinks mine\u2019s a pedophile (he\u2019s our age, thats a whole different story, though)\n\nI have tattoos, piercings and short hair. He\u2019s expressed distaste for all 3 of those traits. Not on me personally but just in general.\n\nHe thinks he\u2019s smarter than me and always tries to prove me wrong even when he\u2019s wrong. Kind of exhibits some narcissistic traits. In fact, he\u2019s a self proclaimed narcissist. \n\nTonight we went out to buy some cat food and somehow the conversation came up about me resenting my dad for cheating on my mom while pregnant. His response shocked me. He said its not my business and \u201cit happens, they just didn\u2019t work out\u201d. It IS my business, it fucked my childhood up. It led to horrible things, tragedies. It made me want to cry just thinking about it. And \u201cit happens\u201d? Him speaking so casually about infidelity hurt my trust even more. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s cheat but this threw me way the fuck off. \n\nI was thinking about moving back with my parents. We live together due to unusual circumstances and have been going out only a few months. Our relationship is pretty good for the most part. We don\u2019t fight, when we disagree we talk about it, he provides for me and I play housewife. He\u2019s talked about marriage and seems really in love with me aside from these things I just listed, he\u2019s an amazing man. Prior to him, I was in a really REALLY damaging toxic abusive relationship that fucked with me big time so I\u2019ve had my guard up since then. I got more comfortable expressing my feelings but as soon as he retaliated with the \u201cannoying\u201d comment I feel like I must keep silent. That\u2019s partially why I\u2019m posting here. He\u2019s a gentleman and super intelligent. I don\u2019t want to lose him. Please, Reddit.
