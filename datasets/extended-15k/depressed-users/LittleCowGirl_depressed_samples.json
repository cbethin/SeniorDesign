I also have an anxiety disorder and ADD, and quite likely undiagnosed OCD (my pseudo-MIL is a nurse and I lived with her for a month over the summer; she was very surprised I did not have any formal diagnosis of such). I grew up in a single parent household with a mother who was too depressed to cope with us, and an older brother fueled by anger; I did a lot of my own raising. Like many women I was sexually abused as a child, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s impacted me. In college I developed an eating disorder because my (ex)fianc\u00e9 told me I obviously didn\u2019t really love him because I wasn\u2019t losing weight fast enough. I generally don\u2019t hang out over in this sub (and I don\u2019t follow it) because I\u2019m too much of an empath and it makes it harder for me to deal with my own things; it just makes me so much heavier to read about more.\n\nMy sweetheart also has a history of depression, a diagnosis of Tourette\u2019s, OCD, and a hormone disorder that relates to a rage disorder. He\u2019s got his own battles, and mostly we are really good about being there for each other, but things have been tough lately.\n\nOver the summer we moved across the country for his job (I stayed with his folks, lovely people, for a month with no purpose while he started work). We\u2019ve been in our house now for two months, and today was my first day working retail. Important to note, I was an elementary teacher and I have no certification in this state. I\u2019m having to jump through the hoops of local whatever to try to get that all sorted, but for now I\u2019m retail.\n\nOn his side of things: he works hard all day (this is very true, I could not do his job), and he perceives that I haven\u2019t accomplished enough and is concerned for both me &amp; the household, as we\u2019ll a stay being frustrated that he\u2019s worked all day and has to come home and do more. He is absolutely right.\n\nMy side of things: I walked away from my support network, the only state I\u2019d ever lived in, and my profession to follow him. During the day I am alone with the dogs (until starting work today, but I\u2019ll get to that). If there are \u201cbig\u201d chores to be done that I can do on my own I will do them about half the time; the other half is because I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m not good at cooking, but I really do try for him (because of the way I grew up \u201cdinner\u201d is not a functionally important thing to me, a can of soup or a quesadilla works as well). Things like the dishes and vaccumming are things I don\u2019t really notice unless their pointed out; the home I was raised in (and the apartment I was in when we started dating) are not acceptable to regular human standards. \n\nPlease understand, I prefer the way he lives. I want to live in a clean house, I want to be his equal, I want to be good enough, and I\u2019m just not. It is very important to note that he has NEVER said anything about my not being enough, but he will comment on the mistakes I\u2019ve made because, in his perception, he is trying to help me improve.\n\nToday was my first day working retail. I was talked down to all day by people who expected me to know everything about the job I was doing, and to do it quickly, while talking to me like I couldn\u2019t read price tags and add or subtract. I have an inner ear imbalance and can\u2019t push a cart straight. I don\u2019t work fast enough (the person training me tried to convince me to start up caffeine or BS supplements to move faster).\n\nIt\u2019s just all so much. If anyone has read through all of this, you are an absolute saint. I\u2019m just exhausted, and I feel like I\u2019m not doing enough (or at least doing well enough) even though I\u2019m doing everything I can. I just need some support.\n\n(Yes, we\u2019ve talked about getting me into therapy. I\u2019m working on finding someone who takes my insurance locally. I do take antidepressants and a low dose ADHD med).\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 394728, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anybody else just so tired of feeling like they\u2019ll never be enough?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9n6j84/anybody_else_just_so_tired_of_feeling_like_theyll/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "LittleCowGirl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gtyjd", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537808251, "domain": "self.Disneyland", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/9ijnyo/my_disneyland_friends_advice_for_a_traditionally/", "id": "9ijnyo", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Help!"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2559bf70-ab15-11e4-856c-22000b368e90", "link_flair_text": "Help!", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Disneyland/comments/9ijnyo/my_disneyland_friends_advice_for_a_traditionally/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1537808253, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Disneyland", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s0df", "subreddit_subscribers": 50830, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Disneyland friends, advice for a traditionally \u2018World girl??", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/9ijnyo/my_disneyland_friends_advice_for_a_traditionally/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "LittleCowGirl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gtyjd", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537807323, "domain": "self.childfree", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/9ijite/my_sweetheart_is_an_amazing_dad_and_it_doesnt/", "id": "9ijite", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "house_only", "permalink": "/r/childfree/comments/9ijite/my_sweetheart_is_an_amazing_dad_and_it_doesnt/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1537807324, "score": 1, "selftext": "Neither of us are kid haters, but we aren\u2019t going to make babies (genetic reasons, plus we like the life we live).

Mid-20s, grew up in Texas, high school in Austin that had the JCC in the attendance zone so high holy days had half the school out. Christian runs deep in my roots, went to a private Christian university that my family has gone to for something like 4 generations now. \n\nThis is totally one of those things that goes back to my childhood (I was that kid who got really into Hanukkah in 3rd grade when we learned about it, and the kid who obsessively researched and had an existential crisis about the Holocaust after reading \u201cNumber the Stars\u201d in 5th). I had Jewish friends in high school, I\u2019ve been to Hanukkah parties and experienced a Seder or two. \n\nThat\u2019s all well and fine, being interested in other cultures is totally a normal thing. But in my growing up I\u2019ve sort of fallen away from the faith I was raised on. The million Bible classes I had to take in college have greatly strengthened my Old Testament knowledge, and I still believe in a higher being, but I don\u2019t think I buy into the whole \u201cJesus or bust\u201d thing, and I *certainly* don\u2019t agree with the mainstream Christian narrative we\u2019ve got going right now. It\u2019s sticky because I\u2019m interested in the Jewish faith, but it feels inappropriate for me to \u201cgo there.\u201d\n\nThat said, I\u2019m still in Texas, but no longer in liberal Austin. There is a Temple here, but there\u2019s seldom a single car out (including when I\u2019ve gone by Fridays).\n\nAlso, my boyfriend is Jewish, but this has nothing to do with him. He\u2019s culturally Jewish more than anything (mixed faith parents, so wasn\u2019t raised on services for either but was raised with the Jewish/Catholic culture blend &amp; identifies as Jewish). He has not gone to any sort of service, and I would not expect him to join me in any service of any faith, but I do worry about how it comes across. \n\nI\u2019ve read a lot, it\u2019s been a \u201cslow grow\u201d of life long knowledge, but I just feel like a fake. Anyone have any advice or encouragement (or, truly, discouragement)? \n\nDoesn\u2019t help that my family would likely flip out!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

That being said, my fianc\u00e9 (who went to WDW once in his life, young, in the late 90s- early 00s) and I are planning on having our honeymoon at WDW. We think the regular dining plan (one QS and one table per day) is probably what we'll go with, a week in the parks (with park hopper added), and driving to get there (2 days each way to/from Texas). \n\nInitially my only rule for a hotel was that it needed to have more than just bus transportation, but now that we are planning on driving I am willing to throw that out the window since we can go park at a monorail/boat hotel and use their transportation, or park at the park itself (for going further out, like Animal Kingdom) as we will be staying at a Disney property and, as I understand it, that is included in the perks of staying at the parks. If that is the case we can stay at any Disney property, so long as it isn't a million miles out (I'm a big believed in taking a break during the park day).\n\nFianc\u00e9 would like to stay in a king bed, since it's our honeymoon (he doesn't require it, just a preference, mostly to have one bed in the room instead of an empty spare), but wants there to be lots of Disney Magic, which tends to be more of a feature of the family rooms. He does not want to stay at a Fort Wilderness cabin as he wants to stay their when we have kids and would like this trip to be distinctly more couple/romantic focused. He feels the Port Orleans king rooms look too much \"like a Marriott, and we can to stay at a Marriott anywhere.\"\n\nOn top of all that, it can't be too expensive (upper limit is probably $500 a night). I feel like I have to be missing something here. I know we're being a little picky, but Disney is so on top of everything that I have to be overlooking it. Disney fun without being too kiddy (though obviously there will be kids around), or too pricey. If it matters, we plan on leaving May 15, driving 15/16, and starting our park days on the 17th. \n\nOh! And if you have any advice for us in general, particularly honeymoon related, let me know!

Because I won't be as good, they won't want to keep me. I know this isn't true. I know they love me, but I have some pretty real abandonment issues, and I can't help but feel that little tug.\n\nI also don't feel like it's at all my place to limit things she might be interested in, even if it's \"my\" thing. Not because I'm the subbiest, but just cos that's not fair or nice! But if she has my rules too and I break one and she doesn't, that makes her better than me and if she's better than me why bother with me..?\n\nI've talked to them about it some, and Daddy insists it isn't like that and I rationally understand that but it's hard... Has anybody had anything like this at all? Have any insight from an outsider looking in? Words of encouragement? Anything?\n\nIf anything didn't make sense, pretty please just ask and I'll try to explain it better! My thoughts don't always come out clear to other people, plus I'm on my phone, plus it's midnight!\n\nIf anything, thanks for reading <3", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "littlespace", "subreddit_id": "t5_2voav", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "It's not jealousy, I'm just sorta insecure...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/littlespace/comments/27qnb9/its_not_jealousy_im_just_sorta_insecure/"}]}
