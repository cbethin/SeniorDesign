Well it was locally owned until a corporate giant bought us out. We were going under due to the universities bad reputation, low enrollment, and bad management. The university refused to budge on our incredibly high rent so thus we had to sell ourselves.\n\nAt first things seemed promising, we'd keep our jobs, pay rate, etc. They told us we had to reapply for our jobs, most of us got our jobs back.\n\nThen everything went downhill quickly. They doubled and tripled prices in the store on most products. We sell art supplies, clothing, and trinkets as well as text books. Before the price hike they literally threw out 2/3 of the stock we had. Our shelves are bare and what little we have is insanely expensive. I'm talking about a 30 dollar paintbrush with a new price tag of 80 dollars. I get cussed out by customers weekly now. We no longer have loyal customers and sales are down for obvious reasons.\n\nAvailability is asked for but often ignored. Every week they mess up my schedule and many others, at least 2 mistakes per schedule. Out of the blue 3 days ago they decided to be open today (Sunday), we are always closed Sundays . Without warning they scheduled me the entire day from open to close. I am only partially available, plus...3 days in advance? Without asking for volunteers or if the people you're scheduling are actually available?\n\nTo top it all off I found out I have to re-apply to my job yet AGAIN as of yesterday. I thought perhaps they were doing it because they disliked me or my performance. All old employees have to reapply for a 2nd time too. What if they just lay me off?\n\nI need a job, this one pays the best. Any recommendations?

They're really big on selling their store credit card and getting emails. When I first started I was in the fitting room for one day. Then they immediately put me on facilities.\n\nFacilities = janitor. Normally it kinda rotated/was punishment for not getting cards/emails. They initially put me on facilities because I had the most open availability. You can't sell cards or get emails during facilities. We only get 4 hour shifts as is, facilities takes either 1 hour of the 4 or 3 hours of the 4 depending on the day and time. Halfway through a 4 hour shift they'll yank me from the floor and make me do facilities. This made it difficult to sell cards and get emails because part of my shift would be cut into and I'd be off the floor. They also schedule me on dead evening nights where we won't see a customer for 45+ minutes. I'm stuck in the cycle of being punished now. \n\nI wanted out of facilities so I pushed hard and I've been getting more emails and I've been getting cards. But I'm still getting extremely shitty shifts, they've actually gotten worse. I've met their \"standard\" but my shifts don't reflect it. Their standard is really hard to meet as only 5 out of 40 employees meet it. The same 5 always meet the standards because they get the best shifts and positions. They even get significantly longer shifts. The ironic thing is, the managers can't even make their own standards. Its also hard to believe that not even one other person out 40 other people doesn't have open availability like me? We live in a state where cows outnumber people 10 to 1 and the managers think we should have the same numbers as a city in California where that cities population is actually higher than our state population.\n\nAll in all, I've been debating quitting because I feel like I'm not being treated fairly.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "jobs", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 180245, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don't know what I'm doing wrong", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/95h002/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_wrong/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Lokesenna", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1533050549, "domain": "self.TooAfraidToAsk", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/93fe3i/my_friends_always_ask_me_to_watch_their_pets_last/", "id": "93fe3i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/93fe3i/my_friends_always_ask_me_to_watch_their_pets_last/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1533050551, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Premise: my boyfriend have a couple we hang out with.

My boyfriends dad had a long going affair while his wife was preggo with their 4th child. When she went into labor he dropped her off at the hospital and left to be with his lover. He wasn't present for the birth and was outed to be with his lover. Divorce soon followed. He left without so much as thinking leaving his ex wife with 3 kids and a newborn. He started a new family and had 3 more kids. He's present in their lives daily providing financial and emotional support. My boyfriend grew up with powdered milk and a mom with no car, sharing 1 bedroom apartments with his family. My boyfriend is the oldest of all 7 kids.\n\nJump to this weekend, the both of us planned to go on a quick camping trip with a concert along the way too. Turns out we were also surprisingly meeting up with his dad and family. I was pretty pissed, but got over it quickly as I knew I'd eventually meet him anyway.\n\nTheir 3 kids were pretty terribly behaved, especially the 12 year old. It got annoying quickly. Then came the comments about my boyfriends mom. They brought her up several times to tear her down, so much so that their kids did it to. My boyfriend sat there with a look on his face saying nothing, he was visably upset. Then his dad asked me if I had met her yet and laughed. It's true my boyfriends mom is very bitter but she has the right to be. They also all talked about my boyfriends 2 other siblings from his dads 1st family and how they're bad for not wanting anything to do with their dad. They simply couldnt understand why they didnt like their dad.\n\nThen came political talk. Obama is the devil and Trump is a saint according to them. \n\nWhenever we went somewhere on our own they'd show up, we went to the grocery store and they ended up coming over too. I was relieved when my boyfriend wouldn't let them invite themselves to our lunch. The kids were annoyingly obsessed with my boyfriend to the point of literally pushing me away from him. They begged to ride with him everywhere, luckily it's only a two person cab but they still insisted on kicking me out so they could be with him. My boyfriend is a very kind timid man, it ultimately leads to a lot of people walking all over him.\n\nI thought it would be over when we drove back to town, it just turned into more family invites. They leave tomorrow, thankfully.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "rant", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn2b", "subreddit_subscribers": 46770, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My boyfriends other family", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/918ba5/my_boyfriends_other_family/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Lokesenna", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1530839459, "domain": "self.unpopularopinion", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/8wfwjz/i_think_less_of_people_when_they_have_certain/", "id": "8wfwjz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "permalink": "/r/unpopularopinion/comments/8wfwjz/i_think_less_of_people_when_they_have_certain/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 1, "retrieved_on": 1530839460, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Anti-gay?
