To give some context, I was originally officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 16 (despite feeling like this since 8) and since then I've been diagnosed with major depression, moderate anxiety, and ADHD. Growing up I would be constantly \"let down\" by people and felt like no one cared about what I would do, whether it be something as little as a piece of art I made or as big as an award. My mom was very much into \"tough love\" and expected perfection out of my sister and I, which she still passively-aggressively pushes on us still despite us being adults at this point. In addition, I've lost a lot of friends over the past year (mostly outgrowning friendships and cutting toxic people out) and I constantly feel like I've failed despite being only 23 with hopefully a long life ahead of me.\n\nOne trait that I would say was a \"negative\" for me was that, since I was really smart growing up and could easily get good grades, I didn't have to work as hard as I should have and would have a habit of being lazy. Then around 11th grade after the diagnosis, I felt like a failure in my honors classes due to my grades as compared to my peers and the amount of work they would put in yet somehow would score higher. Coupled with a less-than-understanding family and low self-esteem, I would turn to outlets to distract myself (such as browsing tech sites or \"other\" habits most high school guys do in their room), I stopped caring. College comes along and after going to my second choice of where I wanted to go to school and disappointing my mom yet again by getting let go from a job with a very large tech company that stressed me out a lot while at college, I started smoking more weed (a habit I casually picked up at 19). I managed to graduate on-time but at this point my work ethic and discipline was non-existent. I worked a lot of hours life-guarding indoors while looking for a full-time position somewhere with benefits and managed to get a contract job in July. In between this time, I had to move back home with my mom that is straight out of the subreddit r/raisedbynarcissists, where when I broke the contract news to her she said \"Oh so you got a temp job?\" despite the job tripling my income. As the contract went along I realized how toxic my office was, as I had many of the coworkers talk negatively about me behind my back despite only being 10 feet away from them. A week ago I moved into an apartment with a roommate and finally have moved all my stuff out of my parents house, cutting my nMom almost completely out of the equation. However, I'm still depressed and resent my current job due to feeling like my skill-set isn't adequate enough coupled with a toxic environment where I can't ask for help.\n\nI currently take meds prescribed by a psychiatrist and see my psychologist regularly, and I've managed to cut down my weed usage to only 1 hit at bedtime and not before/during work. I've also tried to change my friend circle a little to make the people I hang around the kind that have a positive influence around me, and I've applied for jobs elsewhere while working this current contract. However, the laziness trait still exists. When waking up it takes me around an hour unless someone is forcing me to, I have no motivation to complete projects nor even do little things such as go to the grocery store (thank god for Instacart), laundry is mentally draining, and I sometimes worry my meds are making it worse. A lot of times I'll get stoned just so I feel like I have some purpose or motivation (even if it's just to eat) and even then there are times where I can't even find the energy to partake. All I want to do is melt into the ground and no longer exist.\n\nI've talked to my psychologist about whether weed is a factor in this and from what we've observed after I abstained for times it doesn't seem to play that much of a factor, if any (as I still feel the same level of depression/laziness regardless of usage). I want to ideally make it so I don't smoke every day, but currently I feel it's one of the few ways I can get any \"stress-free\" time and therefore motivation to do anything such as Photoshop or code. As a result I feel it's a crux for my current life situation and something I'm using to keep me afloat since my meds make me feel emotionally null. I've also significantly cut my drinking to around 3 drinks a week at most if even that, as alcohol seems to have a negative effect on me mentally and that's been easier for me to eliminate since I don't like alcohol that much. Despite this, I still struggle to get out of bed in the morning regardless of duties, I feel lazy as shit and struggle to accomplish anything, and I feel unproductive and a waste of resources the vast majority of time when at my job. Moving out of my mom's house of influence will definitely help me, but I'm scared I'm now using depression as an excuse to maintain my current mental status (as in the back of my head I want some form of stability in life like most depressed people and can be resistant to changes at times). I want to be productive at minimum, but a lot of times I just feel burned out and unmotivated from doing anything sober that requires more than 5 minutes of my attention. I just want to sleep and stay that way, and I'm tired of feeling this way and I want to change that.\n\nAgain, I understand the weed doesn't help and I'm making efforts to cut down regardless but from what I've observed it isn't the root of my problems and has helped me stay level-headed at certain times. What I really want to figure out is whether I'm just lazy and using depression as a cop-out/excuse to stay lazy and therefore coast through life without having to make any effort or if depression is actually causing me to lose my motivation to try in the first place. If it's the former, how do I train myself to stop acting lazy despite being depressed, and if it's the latter how do I manage my depression to where I can still maintain a productive life and not have depression-induced laziness cost me opportunities such as jobs in life?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 407875, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Am I using depression as an excuse to be lazy and if so how do I stop being lazy?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9yz5dm/am_i_using_depression_as_an_excuse_to_be_lazy_and/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "tassyguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6gtwa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1540688439, "domain": "self.malehairadvice", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/9rzeg9/thinking_of_changing_my_current_style_even_if_its/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9rzeg9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "8380af2a-5496-11e5-b809-0e7e6ff966a1", "link_flair_text": "Advice request", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/malehairadvice/comments/9rzeg9/thinking_of_changing_my_current_style_even_if_its/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1540688441, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys, so for the past few years I've usually got my hair cut every 2-3 weeks down to a #1 or 0 and while I've always liked the look, I want to know if there's possibly something I can try out if only to experiment and try out a new look since my hair seems to grow relatively fast.

I don't care what my sister thinks of my hair obviously as it's my hair, I want something that I could feel comfortable having even if it's just a seasonal look and I go back to the #0 for spring/summer.

I've really hesitated about posting this, but I need help. For context, I'm 23M and currently live with my parents as of this post and have a contract job in IT that pays around $750/week after taxes. I'm also posting from mobile so if there are typos or gaps I apologize in advance.\n\nGrowing up, I always knew my mom was on the stricter side of parenting. She would often be very restrictive on what my sister and I could do (hanging with friends, not allowing us to wear jeans in the summer, etc.) but I always assumed that was just because she was concerned about us and had our best interests in mind and generally, she was well intended in her excuses (requiring straight A's so we could go to a good college, covering our undergrad tuition fees so we didn't have any debt, you get the idea). Any assistance she has given me I have appreciated greatly, even if I didn't always show it. Currently she is letting me live rent-free at her house while I build up some savings and pay off a debt I owe from an eviction from my previous apartment thanks to my ex-roommate lying about his ability to pay rent and my inability at the time to cover both halves of the rent (despite doing that the previous month to avoid said eviction but that's a story for another day). Luckily I have a monthly payment plan setup with the apartment and am actually ahead on payments, so my debt will soon be gone! In a normal world, living with my parents in a situation like this would be a good idea since I could build up some finances, have some stability in my life, and plan ahead so this doesn't happen again.\n\nSadly this isn't my reality.\n\nMy mom has SEVERE anger management issues and, more often than not, will take it out on the rest of the family even if you weren't the one responsible for the anger or get angry for incredibly irrational reasons and overreact in ways that might actually shock you if you came from a normal family. This especially became apparent starting around the beginning of high school for me, as her anger would reach breaking points so easily and would have temper tantrums I can only compare to as ones you'd see in a spoiled toddler. How bad, you might ask? Here are some of her most notable \"episodes\" that I genuinely wish I was making up:\n\n*Freshman year I had a flute solo in my high school band, nailed it perfectly, and got a standing ovation. Her response? \"Your shoes weren't shined enough, you've embarrassed me in front of everyone!\" Proceeds to verbally assault her husband for fucking everything up and not ensuring I looked perfect.\n\n*One time my sister made some purple marzipan and apparently \"stained\" the stone table despite nobody else noticing any evidence of a stain. Naturally, her response was to cancel the family ski trip the night before we were to head off.\n\n*Junior year I went through a self-harm phase for various reasons (depression, lack of self-worth, feeling like I should be punished for my crimes against humanity because I felt I was an evil person, etc.) and she blasts me for how I was just doing it for the attention and should be ashamed of myself.\n\n*The one time in high school I invited friends over she proceeded to go into an angry rage at my dad for having guests over without her permission despite the fact they were school friends in the neighborhood and I wanted to let my mom get acquainted with my friend circle like my sister's\n\n*She tried 7 times to cut me off financially in college for different reasons each time, the \"best\" one being for posting about a promotion I got at my job at the time and apparently \"embarrassing her\"\n\n*Consistent complaints about paying thousands of dollars for psychological healthcare and how the meds haven't \"cured\" my depression/anxiety\n\n*Constantly making bitchy and hostile comments towards me such as \"If your job is obviously so stressful you should just quit and get a retail job since that's all you can handle\" or \"Why do you have anxiety when I'm paying for meds? Obviously they aren't working so I'm just wasting my money\"\n\n*Calling my dad and I pieces of vermin that deserve each other because we spent 2 hours at my credit union setting up a new account\n\n*Falsely accusing me of not working on work-related tasks while at home\n\n*Occasionally she'll place surprise fees on me, such as making me pay for psychiatrist appointments despite promising to pay for them herself or flip-flopping her stance on what she will/won't cover\n\n*Yelling at me on how I was a failure for not getting accepted to a certain college while we were walking into an orientation full of parents and students for an honors program I was accepted to at my eventual college\n\n*Making repeated fat-shaming comments to both my sister and I and how we'll end up fat if we don't watch our diet (despite herself being overweight to put it lightly)\n\n*When I got my most recent contract job, I was excited to tell her how it tripled my income. Her response? \"Oh, so you got a temp job and not a real job\" and when my dad and I asked her just to say something nice about the job she refused to because \"it wouldn't be genuine\"\n\n*Blaming me personally for ruining her marriage despite treating her husband like a housemaid and solely blaming him for raising a fuck up of a son\n\n*Complains about me not wanting to spend time around her despite her either acting like an asshole or forcing everyone to be quiet while we all watch a show she chooses (heaven forbid I suggest a show she might like)\n\n*Refuses to take an interest in any of my hobbies and acts like she's ignoring what I'm talking to her about despite demanding I give her my full attentions and interests\n\nMy psychologist (whom she doesn't know I still see), my friends, and even some coworkers have recommended I move out as soon as possible for my health's sake. I agree with them. My dad wants me to move out as well but wants me to move out in a way that leaves minimum conflict, which is my hope.\n\nHowever, on Friday my mom found my smoking buddy (a filter I used for smoking weed through late at night outside on my porch to minimize scent when smoking a gravity bong hit late at night outside as a stress-relief since the woman saps basically all joy I have for life) as it fell off the porch at 3am and I didn't realize until she went into nuclear volcano mode as I was waking up and getting ready for work. She proceeded to take access to the spare car from me until I can pass a drug test (which knowing her she'll still find some way to change the deal in her favor even if I play by the rules), is making my dad drive me to/from work, called me a junkie, and blamed my dad for raising an addict. This is on top of the already-existing hostility she exhibits towards me. I understand and agree with her anger towards the weed as I constantly told her I was not smoking and am not looking for sympathy for causing this incident nor for smoking weed behind my mom's back, but I am done with living with someone that treats me like I'm a 6 year old trapped in an adult body that has to be checked on for literally everything (I can't even hang up my own clothes without her demanding her husband inspect to make sure I did it properly). She won't let me access my credit information, has all my documents (passport etc.) locked in a safe that I don't know the combo for, has security questions for my credit she set up and won't share the answers to, and will bitch about how much of a fortune she spends on my healthcare despite being the primary source of many of my issues. And every time I see the psychiatrist she requires I give full disclosure reports to her as compensation for her coverage. She makes helicopter parenting look like child's play.\n\n\nThis is where things get complicated. I plan on moving out ASAP as I can afford to move out based on my income and access to transportation methods (Uber, public transit, friends). However, I fear I'd be screwing my dad over in the process as he claims my mom would find some way to make sure he ends up with nothing as she is the primary income source for the family. Basically, if I move out my dad would be on the receiving end of her rage. We have tried to talk her into therapy yet she believes there's nothing wrong with her and her actions and constantly gaslights. If I ran off she'd likely file a missing persons report to get me back. At times she's threatened to kick my dad out of the house and/or divorce him and leave him with nothing if I didn't do what she wanted. Luckily for my sister she has a stable job in another state so I don't have to worry about her as much but I don't know how I could live my life knowing I was the reason my dad's life was destroyed.\n\nI'm at a loss as to what I should do as I feel trapped, attacked, and unloved by the very person that for many people is one of the most reliable sources of support they can depend on. It kills me knowing that this incident with the filter has potentially ruined my dad's life and I constantly feel guilt even prior to the incident for being the source of my family's problems despite acting like most 23 year olds.

If you have any advice on what to do (and how to get out) I would forever be grateful, but more importantly I just want someone to tell me I'm not an evil fucked-up failure of a son and that it's going to be OK in the end.\n\nTL;DR Nmom's hostility has reached breaking point but worried about repercussions of me moving out and constantly feel like a fuck up", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "subreddit_subscribers": 287463, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've reached the breaking point with my Nmom and need to get out ASAP for my own sanity but have little savings financially and no car access with the additional threat of my dad being on the receiving end of her anger if I go", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9aw4jm/ive_reached_the_breaking_point_with_my_nmom_and/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "tassyguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525714320, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/toastme/comments/8hpapw/moderate_depression_anxiety_and_shitty_life/", "id": "8hpapw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/toastme/comments/8hpapw/moderate_depression_anxiety_and_shitty_life/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1525714321, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "toastme", "subreddit_id": "t5_39em5", "subreddit_subscribers": 26977, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Moderate depression, anxiety, and shitty life events and living situation really hitting me hard lately.

If possible, I would really appreciate a motherboard with USB-C and/or Thunderbolt 3, or at least would support it if I got a card reader that has a port or 2 for it.

I'm down for a hybrid storage solution where the OS and key apps are stored on the SSD while media files are on optical or hybrid storage devices. USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 would be awesome.

Some LED lighting would be fun as well as optionally a window, but I want a case where I could put it on my desk and it's nice to look at aesthetically. An example of a well designed case for me would be the Xbox One S case. If there's room for 1-2 DVD drive slots that would be great too.\n\n>**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget?

So right now I don't really buy from too much of a variety of stores, and I only have a debit card with my bank Simple and soon Bank of America (ATM reasons and the fact they're not a digital-only bank and I need an actual checkbook). The stores I really buy from are:\n\n* Amazon.com (I have a Prime membership, buy most of my stuff there, plus my area has Prime Now)\n* Apple, or anything sold on apple.com (I work for them, plus I use their products for developing and the jobs I do plus portfolio building)\n* Adobe (Creative Cloud subscription, I use this on a daily basis)\n* Squarespace (website hosting for my portfolio)\n* Starbucks/Teavana (tea/drinks, mainly Teavana tough)\n* Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo (video games(I swear I'm not an addict) and certain Microsoft products like Windows and Visual Studio)\n* Kroger/Publix (groceries)\n* New York Times (news)\n* Some Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines such as Wired and Vogue\n* Delta Airlines (I live in Atlanta, Atlanta is a hub for them)\n* Etsy (for certain gifts and personal stuff)\n* Gap/Old Navy/American Eagle/ASOS (clothes)\n* Spotify/Apple Music/Netflix/Hulu/HBO Now (entertainment)\n* T-Mobile (phone bill)\n* Restaurants/movie theaters/Ticketmaster/Groupon (for social event stuff)\n* Target (there's one right by my apartment, use for certain items, sometimes groceries)\n\nThis may seem like a lot but I don't shop at all these stores every week/month. For example I only shop for clothes maybe once every 3 months most frequent, Spotify and such once a month, Delta maybe once or twice a year (although depending on how my Apple jobs changes that might change), Apple once a month for when I actually need something from their store (like an Apple Watch, I actually was required by Apple to get one for my job), Etsy only during birthdays/special events, etc. I spend a lot less than people would assume, and I save at least half of my paycheck in the bank for emergencies. I only spend weekly on groceries and gas for my car.\n\nNow with Apple I can get a Barclaycard through them for APR financing on my first Apple product I get within 30 days (helps with the amount of Apple stuff I buy, plus this card would only be used on Apple.com because of my job). I have applied for a DiscoverIT card since that is apparently a really good student card with low rates, and with Amazon they have a store card that looks tempting since I buy from them so much. I don't really care if a card extends my warranty for the items I buy (as usually my items either have a really good warranty or I need to void the warranty for development purposes), I'm more concerned about building up a good credit history and getting more points for the stuff I already buy.\n\nNow for any of you whom are concerned that I will be spending too much and going into debt (which I really do appreciate your concern, shows me y'all wanna help make sure I don't screw myself over), it's important for y'all to know my income is to the level that I can afford to have a higher credit limit (I work 2 jobs and Apple pays very generously for pay and certain benefits I can't list due to my NDA) and even as a college student I make around the lower-to-mid 5 digit income. My only real requirement for these cards if anything is they work with Apple Pay, which as of iOS 9 Discover cards will be added as compatible cards in addition to the other 3 major card providers, so almost all cards will work with it.\n\nThe only reason I really want another card on top of Discover is for places that don't take Discover (there's a lot of places near me that don't take them) or if they have a better points program for what I shop for (such as MasterCard, Visa, and maybe Amex if it doesn't have an annual fee that is ridiculously high). Both my debit cards are Visa, but I want to be in a situation where if I'm somewhere that doesn't accept Discover and my debit account is dry I won't be SOL. If any of y'all have any personal recommendations for good cards it would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nAlso sorry for making this a long post, I just want to give you guys as much info as possible so I get the best recommendation.

Worse, I work 20+ hours a week at Apple doing technical support (mainly to help pay for expenses and tuition), so often I'm burned out by the time I get off my shift. And even on the days off, I cannot focus in class nor bring myself to study for a test myself unless I have a very organized review guide to follow along with due to being obsessive for having perfectly condensed notes to study.\n\nThe burned-out feeling has leaked into other aspects of my life, such as the inability to cook food 90% of the time, extreme difficulty with reading comprehension (even when doing simple activities such as reading in-game dialogue for video games), snapping out at people at times (luckily I have a surprising amount of self-control over these instances, so it's never violent snaps), insomnia, and complete demotivation to exercise (although I'm naturally lazy, so some of that does play into it).

I'm already pretty good at Photoshop and Illustrator if that counts for anything, and I greatly appreciate any advice.\n\nJust a side note, while I prefer the apps I use to be cross platform, as long as I can open and edit the 3d files on Mac and Windows (even if both use separate apps), that's perfectly fine as well.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "3Dmodeling", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sawg", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Best way to learn 3D modeling during a semester at college?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dmodeling/comments/1uletr/best_way_to_learn_3d_modeling_during_a_semester/"}, {"author": "tassyguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1388559995, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1u5atq/stay_classy_walmart_bathroom_stall_stay_classy/", "id": "1u5atq", "is_self": false, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/WTF/comments/1u5atq/stay_classy_walmart_bathroom_stall_stay_classy/", "retrieved_on": 1441977757, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "WTF", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh61", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Stay classy Walmart bathroom stall, stay classy...", "url": "http://imgur.com/fcvgQAU"}, {"author": "tassyguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1388430178, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1u17h7/went_to_a_ghost_town_during_my_vacation_in_death/", "id": "1u17h7", "is_self": false, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/pics/comments/1u17h7/went_to_a_ghost_town_during_my_vacation_in_death/", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1411410497, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "pics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Went to a ghost town during my vacation in Death Valley.

Literally, the only programming knowledge I know is how to say \"Hello World\" in Python. But I really wanna get into coding, as I want to make apps for Windows Phone and eventually iPhone/Android. Also I wanna learn WebKit and some web languages, since I wanna go into Web/Mobile app development for a career. So, I have a few questions:\n\n1. For learning C#, should I start with another language to start like C or C++, or should I just dive headfirst?\n\n2. What does object-oriented mean? And like in dumbass terms too.\n\n3. I'm taking AP CompSci senior year, and in it I'm learning Java. Should I at least start with that and then start working my way through other languages, or can I pull off learning another language at the same time? Mind you I'm gonna be taking 5 AP classes (2 of them semester-long only) during all of this come August, so maybe a language I could learn over summer?\n\n4. How would I go about applying an API?\n\n5. How would I add a GUI to my app/site when I'm coding it? I never really grasped how that happened.\n\n6. If I did learn C# and wanted to move to Objective-C, would there be a big learning curve?\n\n7. What is the best language to learn right now? Opinions are welcome.\n\n8. How do I not get \"overwhelmed\" with trying to learn how to code? I find this happens to me a lot, mainly because I feel like I'm going to never learn it.\n\n9. I know WebKit is an engine, but what does an engine actually do, and how do I \"optimize\" a page for WebKit (or Trident, etc.)? And what are the web languages I should learn?\n\n10. Is Google Dart worth my time?\n\n11. What apps/sites/resources do you suggest I use to practice writing code with?  Like Xcode, Visual Studio Basic, MSDN, etc.? And cold you try suggesting sites that teach it for people who have no background in coding if you can?\n\n12. How do you use elements of other languages in a language i.e. JavaScript and HTML?\n\n13. How would I make a mobile social network like Path and Instagram? Would I need to know Ruby?\n\nThank you to any answers or advice. I know it's a lot, but hopefully this will all help me get me moving along and build an app!", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Best way to learn code?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ud92y/best_way_to_learn_code/"}, {"author": "tassyguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1338431918, "domain": "self.linux4noobs", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/ud7cz/best_starter_distros/", "id": "ud7cz", "is_self": true, "num_comments": 24, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/linux4noobs/comments/ud7cz/best_starter_distros/", "score": 4, "selftext": "Linux is as foreign to me as success is to Lindsey Lohan, but I really wanna get into it.
