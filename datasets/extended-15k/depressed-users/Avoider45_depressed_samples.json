This isn't a problem, I'm happy to get a second job, but it would be much easier if I could simply ask for more hours (even as overtime) at the single job.\nWould it be a bad move to bring this up at the interview? Should I wait to see if a I get a job offer first and then ask? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated! \nThanks.

I'm happy that he enjoys work, and I really wouldn't change anything in that respect. We have always agreed that as we both work part time we will set aside certain days as our days just to hangout and that's where the issue arises - he's started accepting work on those designated days and is now often doing 6-7 day weeks as opposed to the usual five day weeks.\n\nHe either works early mornings and finishes at around 1pm or evenings, starting at 1pmand finishing at 8pm, whereas I always work until 12:30pm and have a later start than him. This means there are cross over periods every day where we could hangout etc.\n\n\nThis is where the 'always on the go' comes in - he won't stop and just spend time with me at all, when he's at home it's cleaning time. Even though it can all be finished whilst I'm at work and he's home, or even be done a few days a week rather than every day. To be clear, I also do the cleaning and maintenance when he's at work, so the house isn't a tip or anything like that. \n\nBecause of this we haven't spent any real time together in weeks, despite my suggestions that he take a break, or we go out on a date or anything like that.\nBy the time we go to bed, he's too tired to talk or get intimate. \n\n\nI honestly just need on advice on how I can approach this problem, as every time I bring it up I seem to get nowhere, and I don't want us to drift apart. \nAm I being unreasonable? \nMany thanks for reading.

I hate it. \n\nBack story bit: I've been depressed since my pre-teens (8) and was formally diagnosed with subtype manic depression at 13. I was on medication for a few years, but It made it worse, so I came off it and remained depressed into my late teens, about a year ago I began to get better - I got a boyfriend who I love very much, moved into my own place and felt like I was actually starting my life (I'm in my early twenties now).\n\n\nCurrent events however have sent me back into a spiral and I feel like I'm a about to lose control. \nMy boyfriend lost his job, I can't afford the rent by myself, and my savings will only last so long. He can't seem to find any work,no matter what we try. We've applied for governmental finance help and been rejected, we have a young puppy who is a nightmare at the moment (though I do love him dearly), my boyfriend is stressed and snappy, I'm stressed and feeling vulnerable.\nIt's really a whole cocktail of disaster for me, as my main depression trigger is stress. I feel like I'm falling to pieces and I don't know what to do. I used to be able to cope with depression, it was effectively all I'd ever known, but now I don't want to go back having known happiness. I'm scared, and i can't talk to anyone, as nobody knew the first time I was diagnosed, and just thought that was 'me'.\nMy boyfriend doesn't need the extra stress of knowing, and I don't think he'd cope well if I told him either (he is a previous depressive himself) and is prone to self blame.\n\nI don't know where to turn, I just know I won't go back onto meds. Everything seems to be turning against the life I've built, and I'm losing the light at the end of the tunnel. This isn't where I want to be. \n\nThanks for reading to the end,\nIt means a lot.

We have recently moved into our first home together, and were previously well over budget money wise. However, as he has lost his job, and was previously the higher paid of the two of us, we now have a bit of a situation: my wages cover rent and electric, and that's it. I have no money for food, water, not to mention petrol and etc for my commute. I have a small amount of savings that will last about a month, and having made a very strict budget this alone is stretching it. I just don't know where to go from here.\n\nMy boyfriend has been looking for work every day since his previous job, but nowhere seems to be interested at all. He is very qualified and has an excellent CV, so it's really unfortunate that nothing is picking up. We've also applied (we're UK based) to the jobseekers and council benefits system, but have yet to hear anything - I suspect we will receive very little help in this respect as my earnings are ever so slightly too high.\n\nTldr: My wages cover rent and electric. We can't afford to live. What can we do?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, and I apologise if this is the wrong place to post this, I'm getting desperate and I can't find any usable advice anywhere. \n\nThank you all for reading this mess of a post.
