But yet, when alone, I end up pretending that something is wrong (Whether it's me or them) and that I should just stop being around them. And when eating dinner, I often just eat and stare out of the windows. Not showing much emotion. I'm guessing my parents suspect something is wrong though. They actually asked me if everything was alright. So yeah, as you can probably tell. I shouldn't be thinking like this, wonderful friends, wonderful family. Yet, there it is again.

I constantly argue with myself, which makes me feel sad, lonely, angry and lost. Then there is the slight stress off school and internship, which isn't difficult per se. I just don't like most people in my class, and the school is unorganized as shit. I just turned another age and I start to feel like a failure. But the thing is, that in general I don't even care much. But it's the way society works I guess, which sounds really fucking edgy lol. But anyhow, for example. I never had a girlfriend. And friends and sometimes kinda joking about that fact, which sure, do your thing but eh. And school people indirectly pressure it as something bad. But I can't help it that I never met someone I had a connection with. Besides what's the point of a relation that lasts like 8 months? But why should I care about this? Why do I start to care about this. Sure I would like to have a loved one.(as in, not friends or family) But I want to have a real connection. Not the type of connection that you know it will fail. But that's just young adult drama, I guess. I do however get angry a lot, when I am alone. Punched myself in the stumic and hit a wall out of sudden bursts of anger. This only happens when I know I am completely alone. After that I lay dead empty on my bed staring at the wall. Lost in thoughts. Listening music usually suppresses this feeling. Which is nice. \n\n\nAll in all, I feel depressed and Reddit is currently the only place I can vent about it. Am thinking about going to my parents, but they have a vacation in a few weeks.

I'm just doing me, and that eases my mind quite a lot. (Often feel alone and or tired of life) But not when I work out, then I just feel.. strong? I don't know, so yeah this might sound cliche, but trust me. Just start by doing some simple stuff. Or sign up for a gym, I go once a week to a gym and it feels pretty good. (You can do a lot at home also tho, a lot cheaper (: )\n\nSo yeah, I hope this might motivate you a bit. Life is a blessing that we should all enjoy.
