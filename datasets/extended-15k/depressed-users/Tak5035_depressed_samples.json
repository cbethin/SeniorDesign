I looked at his court records and saw that he's taller now, 5'5. I can understand how much pent up anger he would have for being nothing but an outcast because of his height for the most important years of his life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n We were both outcasts with very little friends, we both had no one else to turn to in high school. I really didn't see that side of him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I feel really sorry for the guy, I just wish I would've became an even bigger friend of his, and maybe that would've distracted him from his lack of relationships. I needed him and he needed me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really think he took all his hate that was developed through years of middle and high school and channeled it into a last straw mentality that just took him over the edge from yet another rejection. It evens say in the news article that the woman said he did it because she didn't wanna hook up with him. I stood by him through middle and high school and I saw him constantly being rejected, I could've been there for him more than I was. I was just as big of a loser as him, if not more. I was the poorest motherfucker in the whole school. I could've prevented his decline and he could've prevented my decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust looking back now, I remember sitting with this dude for the first half of the school year. Problem is though, when the 2nd half of the school year started up, our lunch times were changed so we couldn't sit together anymore. I just remember the first day sitting there by myself with no one to talk to as I would look around the room to see almost every single table full of people. I was the only person in the whole cafeteria sitting by myself. This obviously didn't last long, because I just couldn't stand to look at other people looking at me sitting by myself, I felt extremely ostracized. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent the rest of those lunch days, sitting in the bathroom until I'd hear the bell ring. I still to this day don't say I was bullied, I just was never accepted. I remember in health class, we had to find a partner to work with for a project and well I'd just sit there during the whole class session and do nothing. I remember looking around the classroom to see if anyone else was as much of a loser as me but everyone else had a partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember this leading me to forgetting health class as a whole, I would just walk the hallways and sit in the bathrooms during health class for about a week, until I decided to just stop going to school. I never told my family, or teachers, or counselors about why I had stopped going to school. I just found that I had done everything in my power to fit in and I had just had it with feeling ostracized. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI eventually did drop out of high school, and I became extremely isolated for about 2 years after that. I would literally just sit and play video games 12-16 hours straight everyday. My family is deadbeat (but not intentionally) to say the least. My mother is severely bipolar and my father is just socially retarded like me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been to some many therapists and they just don't ever seem to get it (and I don't expect them to). I've been diagnosed with autism by a psychiatrist at my local hospital but I get varying diagnoses though because I was at another psychiatrists office and they didn't think I have autism. I don't know why but maybe I was just looking for an excuse or maybe it's just my ocd getting to me because for a few months I was going to so many psychiatrists just to help give me an answer that would've been so superficial in my case. Did I believe a diagnosis of autism, no. Did I believe a lack of diagnosis of autism, no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to excuse this dudes behavior but at the same time I realize this dude, could've easily been me and I'd just like you'd to realize that anyone whose been secluded in school is at a much higher likelihood to commit violent and deadly crimes because we just wouldn't accept them for their height or their poverty in my case. This guys violent behavior was manufactured through the countless people in school that made this guys self worth, nothing. I can imagine how much lifetime pent up anger this dude had, I was there and never came out, I just gave up, I dropped out. This guy had a lifetime of hate ready to be unleashed on to anyone who in that moment would've rejected him. This violence is on not only the hands of this guy but on all the people who wouldn't accept him in school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo see this guy spend years in prison, would be enough for me to finally realize that everything truly isn't as it seems. You can look at this guy and ignorantly just cast him aside like you did for the first 20 years of his life or you could sympathize with everyone, cause everyone has a reputable reason for their positive and negative actions and I truly do believe that the cumulative negative behavior you through at this kid for years and years, was all thrown at this woman that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/carroll/cc-jeremy-evan-leroy-blizzard-assault-20181011-story.html](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/carroll/cc-jeremy-evan-leroy-blizzard-assault-20181011-story.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 395343, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My only close friend from high school is being charged with first degree assault", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9nr1tc/my_only_close_friend_from_high_school_is_being/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Tak5035", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fjd6i", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1536536417, "domain": "self.quittingkratom", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/9ehno5/what_do_you_guys_do_to_distract_yourself/", "id": "9ehno5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/quittingkratom/comments/9ehno5/what_do_you_guys_do_to_distract_yourself/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1536536418, "score": 1, "selftext": "I still haven't kicked this shit yet, the longest I've made it was 3 days.

I decided I'd better be safe and only dose 5 grams of gold bali and red kapuas hulu and boy, am I glad I only did 5 grams.\n\nMy best guess as to what happened was a certain alkaloid was high in both of the strains so when mixed together it caused an increasingly higher amount overall that was way higher than normally would be present in just a single strain of kratom.

I was only expecting around 200 pounds, I couldn't believe I let myself get to that weight because I was always the skinny kid growing up. \n\nI blamed my weight gain on the antidepressants I was prescribed and I just accepted my weight gain as a side effect until the day when I cut the doctors placebo bullshit, and realized that I knew the celexa was giving me absolutely no positive effects and only negative effects (160 to 233 lb weight gain, anxiety).\n\nAnd to top it off, when I talked to my psychiatrist about the negative side effect of anxiety from celexa, he just prescribed me some klonopin which I started abusing (you can look at my other post I made here talking about how kratom has eliminated my benzo addiction). \n   \nAfter finding out I was now classified as morbidly obese I was determined to lose all the weight as fast as possible. Intermittent fasting for 5 days at a time and only eating 1000-1500 calories when I did eat after a fast, for 2.5 months got me down to 170 pounds.\n\nWhen I hit 170 pounds I changed my diet to one large meal everyday at about 1400 calories. I was maintaining that weight so I decided to up my calories to 2000. After a week of eating 2000 calories I gained 5 pounds so I changed my daily intake of food back down to 1400 calories.\n\nI stayed at that caloric intake until I started using kratom, 3 months ago. I started noticing that I was losing even more weight so I go weigh myself and I was down to 155. I knew it had to be a result of my kratom use but I wasn't shocked because that was around what I weighed before I started taking antidepressants.\n\nI didn't complain though because I felt just fine with the amount of food I was eating at my one huge meal in the evening after using kratom at 8am and 2pm. \n\nI let another month pass by not even thinking about my weight at all until I notice that my shorts and underwear wouldn't even stay up anymore. I normally like my underwear as loose as possible, but it was getting to the point that it was just ridiculous.\n\nI head over to walmart and I grab myself some medium hanes underwear, come back home and proudly look at my weight of 140. \n\nI thought to myself, \"okay I'll just eat more food, I can do that I guess, I don't really want to eat anymore food but I don't want to become a weak twig either.\" So I increased my calories up to 2000-2500.\n\nAs my kratom doses went up and up, my diarrhea just got worse and worse. I also had the worst lower abdominal pain of my life, that woke me up in the middle of the night and got so painful that I would just fast walk around the house and hold my breath until I could release the fecal matter.\n\nThis moderate to severe abdominal pain luckily only happens once every week on average because I probably would have tried to stop taking kratom if it would have been a nightly occurrence. \n\nEvery morning though at exactly and I mean exactly 7:30am, I'm still on the toilet with violent diarrhea, I can tolerate the diarrhea at this point though. Luckily the lower abdominal pain has stayed away for the past 2 weeks, which is the longest I've gone without those horrific experiences that wake me up in the middle of the night.\n\nNow, it could just be my diet with absolutely no correlation to kratom because like I said I eat only one very large meal within a 50 minute span totaling at 2000-2500 calories. \n\nThen you might say, \"just eat less food\" but then I'd probably be down to 120 pounds by now because I just weighed myself yesterday and I'm down to 130 pounds. \n\nA part of me was really excited about losing over 100 pounds, but another part of me was like, \"what am I going to do now eat 3000 calories a day\"? \n\nWell, I did eat 3000 calories yesterday. It took me from 5pm to 7pm but I got all the chicken, steak, saucy noodles, potatoes, granola, yogurt, fruit, waffles with syrup, chips, cheese, eggs, and frosted cheerios down. \n\nI still made it through the night without lower abdominal pain so I think that problem is cleared up. And, surprisingly I didn't even go to the bathroom at 7:30 am like I normally do. It's 12:45 pm as I write this and I still haven't gone to the the bathroom yet. \n\nI checked my weight this morning and I was up 4 pounds. I don't know how much of that is fecal matter but I think I should be able to gain some weight if I continue to eat 3000 calories a day.\n\nI don't know if this is a common side effect of kratom or not? If I keep losing weight I guess I'll just have to lessen my kratom intake. Hopefully I'll hit a plateau at 130-135 pounds from 2500-3000 calories a day.\n\nI'm probably an outlier when it comes to losing huge amounts of weight from kratom. I feel fine though, it's just hard to pack on the pounds when using kratom everyday. I was always a skinny kid (5 feet and 90 pounds), I just have to get comfortable with being a skinny adult now.

I was up to 5-10mg of klonopin twice a day just so I wouldn't feel the constant bombardment of other people's negative thoughts. \n\nI was diagnosed with mild autism, depression, and social anxiety and was prescribed celexa, haldol, and klonopin. The dose for the klonopin was set at 1mg twice a day. \n\nThe first time I took klonopin I noticed a whole new world when I was around people. I could actually look people in the eyes without shaking and I could connect with people in a way that I thought was never possible. \n\nBut something this altering surely had to have repercussions. 2-3 weeks later I wasn't getting anywhere near the same effect as before so I decided to stock up on benzos for the next 4 months while the prescription was still available for me. \n\nDuring this time I was back to my old self, I wouldn't leave the house and I was incredibly socially isolated. I wouldn't even talk to my parents that much anymore and it got to the point that I wouldn't even play video games which was my only real hobby.\n\n4 months went by and it was time to go see my psychiatrist again. I had to blatantly lie to him when he asked me if I was taking all the meds as prescribed which made me feel the biggest amount of guilt one could feel. I walked out of that room with a prescription for klonopin that would last another 4 months.\n\nRight after I left the psychiatrist that same day I was at home with 4 bottles each full of 60 1mg klonopin pills. I started dosing at 2mg twice a day that night.\n\nI felt like a new man, like I could conquer the world and I was in a new mindplace that I should have always been in. I helped with chores around the house, I was talking with my family more than ever, I was actually speaking for myself in public instead of my parents doing the talking for me. \n\nI couldn't have been more in tune than I was for those 2 weeks. But that quickly changed when I decided to up the dose to 4mg twice a day because I was losing the pazazz that I once had.\n\nWhen I uped the dose to 4mg, my family started noticing that I wasn't acting quite right. My mother kept asking me all day long \"are you sure you feel okay, you look like you're really tired\"? I had to lie to my own mother about my drug abuse which made me feel nothing in the moment because I was so sedated that I was literally a walking zombie with absolutely no emotions and no memories of what happened on that day or what I did yesterday.\n\nOnly a week went by and I was uping the dose again, and then again, and then finally one night about 6 weeks since I had started abusing klonopin I was in a mindset that, I don't even know how I got there but I truly was considering ending my life by overdosing on klonopin mixed with alcohol.\n\nYou can even see a post I made on suicidewatch 4 months back when I was on klonopin still (that I literally don't even remember posting) and the day that I made that post was the day that I came pretty close to ending my life.\n\n All I remember was that the effects of the klonopin from my morning dose were wearing off and I just started swallowing pill after pill of klonopin (probably was 20-25mg maybe even more) in a deep confused state along with a few shots of vodka that I had taken an hour beforehand.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after I had done this I was in shock with what I had just done and I quickly dialed 911 and got to a place where the paramedics would see me when they arrived. I remember opening my garage door (so the paramedics would have a direct line of sight to me) and then just collapsing to the ground and there was no recollection after that until I was in a hospital room with a bunch of IVs in my arm.\n\nNext thing I remember was a person shoving a paper in front of me to sign for a voluntary admission to a psychiatric unit. I heard the guy say that if I didn't sign the paper than he would admit me involuntarily so I just went ahead and signed the paper.\n\nI'm going to skip talking about the withdrawals because I could go on all day about how they were so horrible that in some moments you feel like you just can't breath. But what is even more terrible than the psychical withdrawals, were the emotional withdrawals. \n\nOne hour I would be depressed to the point that I would cry at literally nothing, the next hour I would be manic to the point that I was yelling at my parents in the middle of the night for no reason.\n\nAbout 6 weeks later the withdrawals were finally over and once they were over, even through all that hell I was still thinking about taking benzos again. Luckily, my family was looking out for me, they removed all the klonopin so that the easy fix wouldn't be in the back of my mind constantly.\n\nAbout 2 weeks go by and I'm still doing nothing but thinking about what it once felt like to be normal, and then I stumble upon Kratom and at first I thought to myself \"this is just going to be another rabbit hole that leads back down into a miserable climax\". But as I continued to read on and on I felt as though this is my replacement, this is the non-invasive and non-addictive and non-life threatening and non-pharmaceutical option that will help me control my constant urges for benzos and might even help me cope with my social anxiety and autism.\n\nI ordered just an ounce of green malay to start out, just in case it was a bust/overhype. I started out at 1 gram and I wasn't let down at all. I felt a relaxing sensation that was similar to benzos but drastically different in the sense that Kratom doesn't fog your brain up and fuck with your memory.\n\nI couldn't do anything but praise Kratom when it comes to taking your mind off of other addictive drugs like benzos or even worse opioids. It surely also helps with depression and social anxiety (depending on the strain).\n\nAnd to hear the constant outcry's to ban Kratom infuriates me cause I know what will happen to those people addicted to heroin and I know what will happen to me. I feel all this worry about what will happen to me if I won't have Kratom as an option. I can only imagine what worry people addicted to heroin must live with if they won't have Kratom as an option. \n\nThe worry of overdosing will be there but the constant thoughts of turning back to the streets for the abundantly available heroin and for me benzos that might be laced with a life ending dose of fentanyl will inevitably outweigh the worry of overdosing.\n\nI don't know what I would turn to without Kratom but I for sure know that it wouldn't be safe.     \n\n ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "kratom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qx0h", "subreddit_subscribers": 40121, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Kratom has kept my mind off of benzos", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/86tuyb/kratom_has_kept_my_mind_off_of_benzos/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Tak5035", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1521293695, "domain": "self.kratom", "edited": 1521293896, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/853r1q/blood_pressure_on_kratom/", "id": "853r1q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/kratom/comments/853r1q/blood_pressure_on_kratom/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1521364712, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I've tried a variety of strains over the past 7 weeks.

So I decided to quit cold turkey and I was successful but the severe anxiety you get when you feel like you can't breath at times as the drug is leaving your system was a nightmare. \n\n I then heard about Kratom a few weeks ago and did tons of research with some websites saying it's a stimulant while others were saying it's a sedative.

I was also surprised with the taste of the kratom. Everyone was saying the kratom was disgusting but I actually enjoyed the bitter taste that it offered.

I tried to reach for a drink of water but I couldn't even make out where the drink was because my depth perception was in another world. I would go to move my legs and then they would fly up 20 times farther than I wanted them to go and I know this because I heard my legs crack against the glove compartment.\n\nHalfway to the ER, I told my brother to turn the car around and head back home because I got a rush of euphoria that lasted for about a minute but then turned back into a \"I'm going to die for sure\" perception that made me vomit and revitalized those feeling of get me to the hospital asap.\n\nIn hindsight I probably didn't need to go to the hospital but when I was under the effects of DXM, I didn't know what to believe. When I got to the hospital I was still able to tell the doctors my name, my address, my birthdate, and everything. Which is why they probably thought I was pulling a prank on them.\n\nThe person who was pushing me with the wheelchair yelled at me to put my legs on the leg rest. But it literally took me about 1 minute to find a leg rest in my visual field because everything was so zoomed out and washed like someone took a paintbrush and smeared all the colors of my visual reality to the point that I didn't know what was what. \n\nI got to another doctor that took my blood pressure and said if you do this again you're going to DIE. After he said this I got an intense rush of euphoria that made me just want to \"get the fuck out of here\". They pushed me over to my bedside and at this point I was overcome with regret because here I was next to a hospital bed while I was euphoric as fuck and the nurses were screaming at me get into the bed. I just calmly told them but I'm comfortable right HERE so why would I wanna move over there. Obviously at this point, I was over my dysphoria and paranoid part of the trip and I begged that they just let me leave but they wouldn't.\n\nI heard someone in the background laughing at me saying isn't this what lil wayne(the rapper) trips on. And then, I heard a male voice say yeah, lil wayne is fucking retarded. After I heard them say that it made me laugh out so fucking hard.\n\nAnyhow, they eventually forced me onto the bed and one of the nurses said \"do you think this is a fucking game\". And, I replied I'm not trying to make this out as a game. After they hooked up the basic IV and heart monitor crap, I felt overwhelming thoughts that told me to unhook all this shit and walk out of this hospital but I was tripping so hard that I probably would have just collapsed in confusion.\n\nBesides the IV, I was also given potassium chloride. I told the nurses that I wasn't trying to overdose on DXM(and how even could you with just 360mg) and they said I shouldn't be trying to get high off of cold medicine and that I should try marijuana instead(which I already have at least a 100 times). \n\nI told the nurses that I didn't want a crisis worker to come in and talk with me but they brought one in anyway. Luckily they left it up to the doctor to give the final call and the doctor of course let me leave. I was in the ER from 9am-3pm. The trip started around 8:00am and ended around 11am though. \n\nI don't know what made this trip so drastically different from my first trip. Maybe it was my restrictive diet( I was only eating 500 calories for the past 2 weeks) or maybe it was the fact that I have cyp2d6 enzyme deficiency but wouldn't when I took 300mg of DXM been a nightmare as well.\n\nI think I'm going to give it at least 3 months until I try DXM again and when I do, I'm going to make sure that I'm consuming at least 2000 calories a day for 2 weeks before I trip and I'm going to start back up at only 240mg and see what happens. And if I get these paranoid thoughts I will ensure myself that these thoughts will pass and positive thoughts will ensue shortly. And, I also might just stand out in 30F to help make the hot sweats less noticeable.\n\nI was probably just a pussy because this is my first time experiencing a horrible trip or reaction to a drug. Believe it or not, this experience was more life changing than my first trip. Be careful with this drug and make sure you're in peak mental and physical condition before you take this drug. And don't be an idiot and live on a starving diet of 500 calories a day like I did before uping your dose even slightly. \n\nI'll be back in 3-6 months to try DXM again but I respect this drug even more now, knowing you can't just fuck around with it.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dxm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7ak", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "2nd trip was a living nightmare", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dxm/comments/7amsye/2nd_trip_was_a_living_nightmare/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Tak5035", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1509163652, "domain": "self.dxm", "edited": 1509176892, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dxm/comments/79860w/losing_weight_and_fighting_social_fear_after/", "id": "79860w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "firsttime", "link_flair_text": "First Time", "locked": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/dxm/comments/79860w/losing_weight_and_fighting_social_fear_after/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1509270134, "score": 11, "selftext": "I tried 300mg of DXM for the first time 2 weeks ago and since then I've already lost 15 pounds(from 225 to 210) because I literally have almost no appetite so I force myself to eat just one meal a day at about 500-800 calories.\n\n I've also noticed other effects such as I'm a little more social, and of course when I'm actually tripping I'm extremely social which is a huge relief to me because I've struggled with getting out of the house and meeting people because of a phobia of talking to people because I feel as though I've been rejected by people my whole life.\n\n I noticed that my family has seen changes in me because they seem to give me looks that I conclude to mean \"why is he not being as reclusive as he usually is\"? That leads me into telling you guys about how I seem to have more telepathic sensations(that I believe 100%) from not only my family but from random strangers in public. And, the best part is these telepathic sensations don't make me want to isolate, they make me want to socialize more than I have in years. I see myself changing mentally but I still don't see other people changing their mentality of me much, YET!\n\nI'm thinking about uping my dosage to 450-500mg the next time I trip. I can only imagine what effects I'll experience when I'm tripping and most importantly what affects I'll have long term that will benefit my life.\n\n Most people go into DXM just to get fucked up, I went into DXM in that same manner not even thinking that I could be changed into another version of myself that doesn't feel as imprisoned by other people.\n\n During the trip is where feelings gripped me like they never did before and these thoughts told me \"why do you let people control you to the point that you can't just be yourself for once\", \"why are you losing touch with not only yourself but your family as well\"? During the trip I just wanted to run upstairs to tell my brother and my mother that I didn't realize how gone I really was, but I obviously couldn't do this or they would know I was on something.\n \nRight after the trip ended more intense thoughts rushed over me that made me look at activities and endeavours that I feel as though took away my self esteem due to thoughts of failure after spending 2-3 years working on it only to give it up because I wasn't improving, essentially what these thoughts told me was \"why did you ever let failure take away the drive to never give up, because giving up is the real failure in \"failure\" so maybe it's time to give up this endeavour but don't let your past failures stop you from taking up new studies in life. \n\nI walked away from this experience and about 12 hours later as I was trying to fall asleep, I began to cry like I've never cried before realizing that this is the start of my life, I will never be able to get back those 19 years but this is the start.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dxm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7ak", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Losing weight and fighting social fear after taking DXM for the first time", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dxm/comments/79860w/losing_weight_and_fighting_social_fear_after/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Tak5035", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508288930, "domain": "self.Drugs", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/7736jv/dxm_might_be_the_only_drug_that_will_help_me_come/", "id": "7736jv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "permalink": "/r/Drugs/comments/7736jv/dxm_might_be_the_only_drug_that_will_help_me_come/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1508370279, "score": 3, "selftext": "I just tried 300mg dxm and I for one can say that when I was tripping/high it completely masked my crippling social anxiety that I suffer with everyday.

Anyhow, onto the game I want reviewed.\n\nI tried a different opening with both stones on the 3x3 points because I've been having better results lately when I play extremely territory oriented. My opponent started developing large moyos and I decided to invade both moyos right away. At the top of the board I had a weak group that my opponent forced downwards into what I thought was surely going to turn into a dead group but I somehow managed to turn it into a capturing race, which I won by one move. In the process of this happening though, my opponent gained tons of influence and territory on the top and towards the center of the board, at this point I think my opponent was still ahead by about 20-30 points. During the endgame, I played a ko threat that my opponent misread, leading to his group in the bottom left turning into a ko fight for the life of all his stones. The ko fight ended in an even exchange I think, but after this ko fight I was now ahead by 20-30 points. I'm taking this  as a loss though because if my opponent wouldn't have made a mistake during the endgame then I would've lost. \nhttps://www.online-go.com/game/9205545", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "baduk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqe", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Review Request 13K vs 9K", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/6jj7bc/review_request_13k_vs_9k/", "view_count": null}, {"author": "Tak5035", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483118896, "domain": "self.depression", "edited": 1483119281, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5l4lgd/nothing_interests_or_makes_me_happy_anymore/", "id": "5l4lgd", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/5l4lgd/nothing_interests_or_makes_me_happy_anymore/", "retrieved_on": 1484457291, "score": 7, "selftext": "Nothing, not even my favorite video game, cs go, not even my favorite band, Shinedown.

I really don't know what I'm doing with my life, one day and the next \n\nday and all I do is play cs go and I don't know what else to do, I quit high school and I have no job, this is the life \n\nthat no one wants to live and I chose to go down this sad depressing path and I don't know how to turn back, I \n\nmean I have fun in game but where will I take this game in life if I just suck so badly at it, I could get into twitch \n\nstreaming but I don't feel a drive for doing that cause I'm really shy and I don't feel like talking to people and I've \n\nbeen like that my whole life, I had zero friends in school my whole life, elementary school, zero friends, middle \n\nschool, zero friends and high school, zero friends. All I had in all my schooling years was harassment and people \n\nmaking me feel like nothing but shit about myself and I had a mother who forced me to go to school every single \n\nday and I went to school every single fucking day and I got perfect attendance for all of my elementary school \n\nyears. Having no one to turn to for all those years growing up and when I had my family to turn to I just didn't feel \n\ncomfortable enough to talk about how I was really feeling so I turned to nothing but video games. My grandmother \n\ngot me into video games, she played a lot of casual video games like spider solitaire and match 3 games on her \n\ncomputer and she let me play some with her and this is really all I had growing up, and she may have been the \n\nonly person I really opened up to in my life. My mom was a pretty cool person when I was growing up, but she was \n\nalways kinda weird because she has bipolar and some other type of mental issue that I don't truly understand. I \n\nalso have another huge story of my life that changed it for the worse and I mean it completely shattered and \n\nruined my whole life. So what happened was I got on my facebook and I was chatting random girls through \n\nfacebook chat back when I was a freshman and I started talking sexually to this girl and she didn't like it so it \n\nescalated to the point that she started to call me names and a friend of hers got mad at me too and he wanted to \n\nfight me at school. I then proceeded to make threats towards this black kid and this girl and well the girl reported \n\nme and to make a long story short I was suspended for 5 days and then ultimately expelled for a year plus and I \n\nhad to go to another school for bad people where all the kids would talk about was nothing but drugs drugs and \n\nmore drugs and it was so out of my way of life and while I was there all I tried to do was act like was a bad ass \n\nwhich I felt so uncomfortable doing and it was just such a depressing and set back on my life that I felt like just \n\ncommitting suicide at this point and to make matters worse while I was there I did another seriously stupid thing, I \n\nwas dared by some people to call this girl a nigger and I chickened out but the worst part was that I went home \n\nand then proceeded to call her a nigger on facebook at this point I guess I did this cause I didn't give a single fuck \n\nanymore and I was willing to just do whatever to just I guess feel like a bad ass. So for doing that I was suspended \n\nfor 2 days and I really didn't know what to think of at this point. My sad and depressing life didn't really make any \n\nsense at this point, I was in a high school where all the bad kids were, these kids were all into drugs, and I mean \n\nall of them, and I felt so out of place because I never did any weed or even alcohol or anything at all and these kids \n\nwere doing hardcore drugs like acid and Heroin and I don't even know what else. Plus I to be honest am a super \n\nugly looking nerdy kid that has still never had sex and i'm 17 now, in fact I've never even kissed a girl. You can see \n\nnow how much I felt out of place, and this is how I felt my whole life, like I didn't fit into the crowd but this was \n\nmultiplied by 100 in this environment, also I had to join this group of more bad kids for sending these threat \n\nmessages that I really didn't mean at all and I just made these threats because I was kinda furious at that moment \n\nand I wasn't really thinking. This was just another group of kids that were just drugs drugs drugs and nothing \n\nmore. So I stuck all of this misery and pain out for over 6 months and when it was time to go back to back to my \n\nschool, I was told that I had to stay half of the next school year and this was because I called some girl on facebook \n\na nigger. So I stayed for that time and it was another rough long amount of miserable time that I just gave my all \n\nto make it through and at this point I just didn't know what my family thought of me because they didn't speak a \n\nsingle word to me about all this school drama and shit. Some days I woke up and thought to myself this isn't who I \n\nam and I don't know what to do to make myself feel just good, but finally the time came and I was ready to head \n\nback to my normal high school, which I wasn't really happy to go back to because I had absolutely no friends and \n\nno one to talk to. To shorten this up a bit basically what happened was I went back into this school and I sat in \n\nthese classrooms and I felt more depressed than ever because I just didn't have anyone to talk to about my \n\nmiserable and depressing life that i'd been living for the past 2 years and once again I felt like I just didn't belong \n\nor fit in at all. Another thing that I think really turns people away from me is the fact that I wear the same plain \n\nwhite t-shirt everyday and I only have like 3 or 4 pairs of shorts and it makes me look like I'm poor which I guess I \n\nam, plus I don't even have a cell phone and that also makes me feel like i'm not apart of the crowd in this day n \n\nage. I really didn't want a cell phone anyway because I don't really have any friends to call or text to, which makes \n\nme think to myself why the fuck did I make a facebook account anyway, I mean whats the point if I don't have any \n\nfriends to talk to on there anyway. So basically what happened with school was I got 2 days off of school for when \n\nmy grandmother died, which I surprisingly wasn't really upset about at all, but after these 2 days off of school I \n\njust didn't feel like going back, not because of my grandmothers death but because of just not fitting in at school \n\nand just because of the whole scenario that was taking place. I didn't want to go back to this place where I felt so \n\nout of my comfort zone and having no one to talk to and just having to sit there all day thinking to myself about \n\nthe whole mess I had gotten myself into and never really feeling comfortably to talk to anyone and even my family \n\nI didn't feel comfortable talking to because they never even spoke to me that much about the whole scenario. So \n\nwhat happened was I didn't go to school for 3 plus weeks so I was kicked out and I had to enroll to take classes at \n\nnight at the same school I was at for threatening some girl on facebook. Which I did go to the next school year for \n\njust 2 classes and then I just decided not to go for a day, which turned into 2 and then 3 and then I was kicked out \n\nbecause you couldn't miss more than 3 days in these night classes. There is the long story of my sickening and \n\nsuper depressing school life which I don't know how I made it through that long without honestly just ending my \n\nlife. At this same time though my brother was nice enough to get me a somewhat okay gaming computer where I \n\ngot into a game called cs go which I was talking about at the beginning of this discussion. This game literally took \n\nover my life but not really because this was my life at the time because I dropped out of high school so there was \n\nno life to be taken over, just a life to start and this was my life. I also got into watching twitch streams of cs go and \n\nthe first streamer that I started watching a lot was a streamer by the name of JoshOG, his name was originally \n\nTheoriginalweed. I watched him so much and that was basically my life at the time, I watched Theoriginalweed and \n\nthen I went and played some cs go after watching him have fun with friends in cs go. I enjoyed watching his \n\nchannel slowly grow from 3,000 followers when I first started watching his stream to 10,000 and then 50,000, and \n\nhe eventually got a sub button for people who want to subscribe for $4.99 and he got cool emotes. I always wished \n\nI could subscribe but I couldn't I was only 16 and I'm 17 now and I didn't and I still don't have a credit card. Right \n\nnow he has 786,218 followers and I was happy to be apart of the ride and I'm glad he was so successful with his \n\ntwitch career, I had no idea when I first started to watch him when he had only 3,000 followers that he would turn \n\ninto one of the biggest streamers on twitch. I never really got into streaming myself and I don't intend to, I just \n\nenjoy watching streams and of course playing cs go, which I now have over 2,000 hours in. I still suck at the game \n\nafter even 2,000 hours of playing which I'm not that happy about but I still really enjoy playing the game and \n\nhaving fun. So that is my sad and depressing life that lately has been pretty depressing too because after playing \n\nthe same game for that long and still sucking at it is kinda demoralizing and this is all I have left in life cause I \n\ndropped out of high school and I have no friends cause I live a super sheltered life where I don't go out of the \n\nhouse and I don't even have a fucking cell phone. What do I do with my life now that is my biggest question? I \n\nknow I'm only 17 but I feel like I'm 39 and I already have a bunch of gray hairs so I don't what to think about that \n\neither. Something else is that I think that I'm just so stupid and that is probably true and I have no guidance \n\ntowards what to do now in my life now? I'm honestly so depressed lately that I don't even feel like brushing my \n\nteeth or even washing my hair, I just Don't feel an urge to do anything with my life besides just sit and play/watch \n\nvideo games all day long. There you have it, my disturbing and utterly depressing life. The End.
