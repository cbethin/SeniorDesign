I don't know how to fix myself, and my family isn't helping by insisting I'm just lazy, I'm just fine. I want emotional validation but I cant ask it from them.\n\nI remember just crying and felt really upset when I had to go accompanying my parents to my older sibling graduation day. I hate crying for no reason, but there I am years later still cried a lot without any reasons.\n\nSince last year it's been getting worse because I just feel like I can't do anything. It won't even matter if I graduate, then I stop trying at all. I don't know how to deal with this.\n\nI don't know if it's depression or cptsd, it's confusing. I don't know if this is a flashback or not, but basically it's like nothing happened. There's no  specific trigger, I  think.\n\nFor example when I was driving, I just suddenly felt like shit, like a long running thought just rambling about how I'm graduating super late, about how my time in school are wasted, about how I ended up with no friends, how I self sabotage. I ended up crying usually and force myself to sleep, shutting the room from anyone else. This extends for a week or two but inevitably it cripples me to one month and more and more. During this period, I usually binge eating, hyper aware to sounds, and shower for maybe 2 times a week. If I ever go out I ended up driving with no destination.. .
