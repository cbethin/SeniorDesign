I am 21 years old and I have recently moved out from home with my other half. From the age of 12 I have battled with anxiety, depression, eating disorders and physical health issues. I am struggling with the concept of living. Working 40 hours a week, just to live, is an exhausting and depressing concept to me.\n\n\nWhen I was 12 I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (or \"M.E.\") it's a condition where I felt extremely tired all the time, I was bed bound most days and in a year I probably attended 2-3 weeks of school. This was a distressing time for me and my family; my mum essentially became my full-time carer. Looking back; I believe I was experiencing depression and anxiety, but instead I used the illness as an excuse. I began to gain weight on top of this and slowly developed eating disorders.\n\n\nUntil the age of 17 I struggled with school, barely coping, scraping through my GCSEs. I couldn't get through A Levels and instead attempted to teach myself, which also failed. Then from the age of 18 I had a part time job as a lifeguard while still living at home. This was the first time I was really able to cope. I became more social, more active, I began to properly enjoy life. It was the first time I really felt like I belonged and enjoyed getting up to go to work. (Despite struggling with anorexia/bulimia and an emotionally abusive boyfriend. But that's a whole other post).\n\n\nI met my boyfriend and now life partner at said job. We have been together for nearly a year and have recently moved in together. I recently left the lifeguard job to pursue social care, I wanted to be a counsellor for the longest time. However, working full time as a support worker in a home for mentally ill completely drained me. I realised this was not the path for me, and I am now working as a customer sales advisor for a home appliance company.\n\n\nI am miserable in this job, and living with the idea of this now is how I have to live. I still struggle with depression and body issues. I have on and off bouts of uncontrollable crying and sometimes self harm. I want so much to be able to function like a regular person, go to work, eat, sleep. But I can't, I am drained.\n\n\nI don't understand how people just...do life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_subscribers": 397036, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I can't do life anymore...how do I still feeling this way", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9oxugo/i_cant_do_life_anymorehow_do_i_still_feeling_this/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "lottienickie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_173diba9", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539598389, "domain": "self.depression_help", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9obdy0/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9obdy0", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression_help/comments/9obdy0/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1539598390, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "depression_help", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zy2x", "subreddit_subscribers": 18149, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don't know what's wrong with me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9obdy0/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/"}, {"author": "lottienickie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_173diba9", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538990025, "domain": "self.curlyhair", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/9mdb0n/a_lot_of_hair_falling_out_on_a_daily_basis/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9mdb0n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#fb7f72", "link_flair_css_class": "one", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "762e5196-21dd-11e6-90ce-0ebfe7658481", "link_flair_text": "help", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/curlyhair/comments/9mdb0n/a_lot_of_hair_falling_out_on_a_daily_basis/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538990026, "score": 1, "selftext": "As you can see I have a lot of hair.

We slept together about 2 weeks into dating (which felt like a long time since we were friends for a few months previously). The first few times we slept together were a little awkward, he wouldn't make much eye contact, tried to stick it in me floppy sometimes, I think I told my best friend that it felt like he was just \"masturbating with me\" lol. But I thought nothing of it, since the first few times are always a little awkward with a new person. \n\nHe gave me the impression he'd slept with a lot of girls, not hard to believe as he's a very handsome guy with a fair bit of charisma.\n\nUntil a couple of weeks ago he told me I took his virginity!? He said he'd never been with anyone he cared about enough, been with long enough, or they simply didn't want to. And that eventually he got so old he didn't want to just give that to anyone. \n\nI don't know why he wouldn't have told me!
