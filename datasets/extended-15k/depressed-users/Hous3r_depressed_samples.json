Just really want to get things out of my system.\n\nThis academic year has been the hardest year in my life. I am studying Computer Science and I am in my final year. Last two years were really great. I am studying abroad because I wanted to explore new things and sort of try to challenge myself, so I can grow not only in the subject that I chose, but also as a person. And it has been a great experience even if most of the time I didn't know how to make friends as I always had social anxiety. But even so, I have made so much progress, that I think I am almost social anxiety free sometimes. And it's only because I challenged myself again and again even though every failure has been so hard to deal with. I went to Hack societies and hackathons in various cities on my own to build new things with people around the world. I can say that some people are just wonderful. I have met these kind, smart and just  very nice people who are pure geniuses. And the best thing is when they are so kind and humble that they don't think of me any less. It's such a pleasure to meet such kind of people, even if my social anxiety is exploding through the roof. And I am so grateful for that.\n\nBut this year has been utter bullshit. And I honestly cannot explain how I got here. Of course, it's not like anyone died or I became homeless, there are people with much worse problems. But pain and struggles have a tendency to fill in your whole mind, no matter what it is.\n\nI had to choose my undergraduate dissertation topic which I couldn't think of. I had this stupid idea that I had to choose perfectly and do it perfectly that I really struggled coming up with anything at all. I am just undergraduate, it's not like I am doing Ph.D.. So I procrastinated with this until there was nothing much else to choose and I ended up with something random. It's something to do with debugging, but I won't go into that.\n\nThe whole year, I really struggled with it. Mainly because I had so much anxiety about it. My sleep quality worsened and I couldn't wake up for classes anymore, because I would stay at night, avoiding the days, because somehow I feel safer at nights. As if the night is when life stops and you can just relax for a bit.\n\nSo I missed a lot of classes this way. Assignments were harder and harder to do. I was so depressed at this point, I couldn't leave my bed. And I was always thinking to myself, what is happening? It's not like this is the end of the world. I wasn't sure if this was at all due to my dissertation or something else entirely.\n\nI went to my doctor and got prescribed anti\\-depressants. 50mg of Sertraline also known as Zoloft. It helped at first. I had horrible side\\-effects including tremors and muscle pains but it made me happy and hyperactive. I thought that this will finally help me be like myself again. I was all over the place, I thought life is amazing and I can do everything. It did help me with exams but everything got worse eventually after taking it for a month. I got really numb, and the initial happiness and hyperactivity disappeared. Now I was just stuck in bed again, because I was always exhausted, numb and apathetic. The thing is, I didn't care much, because it made me not care. I spent most of my days in bed, binging tv shows like Friends or Rick and Morty. And binging on food as well. Because it made me very hungry for sweets and junk food. I gained weight this way, managed to do nothing like I was some sort of a vegetable. I was aware of this, so I decided that I need to do something about it. Maybe it was a dumb decision to make, but I decided to lower the dose without consulting my doctor. I thought this was a smart thing to do, because I usually felt better just before taking anti\\-depressants.\n\nI did feel a bit better,  but only because it was just a bit easier to think. It brought back many of my anxieties and panic attacks, but I at least I was able to think a little.\n\nNow I have 4 days until I have to submit my dissertation and guess what, I haven't done much at all. The weird thing is that I don't care. I know I should care, but I just don't. I am pretty sure I won't make anything good in those 4 days.. I am still waiting to know if I can get an extension. And I might get it because I often did speak with university staff about my problems and I have my doctor's note. But I am still afraid that even if I get the extension, I will just procrastinate until the last minute again. And I am just so tired of dealing with this, to the point where I don't know how much I really want my degree at all.\n\nSometimes I just think that it doesn't matter. Nothing does. I wish I could just disappear somewhere. Buy a ticket and leave somewhere. Find a random job and just start fresh. Maybe do something crazy that I was always afraid of. Like doing music or something with film. It's not that I don't like programming, but there's so much negativity associated with it that I feel like I need a break. I used to like it a lot, especially when I was just doing my own projects at home when I was younger. \n\nI don't know what this all means to anyone reading this. Even to me, this sounds like garbage. Feel like an entitled kid in a good university crying about things I have to do.\n\nI just wish I cared more. I wish I was like one of those smart kids I met who were always eager to solve problems and do things they are passionate about. And I just feel like I am just barely doing anything at all. Doing enough just to survive. Wasting yet another day, day by day.\n\nI am still positive somehow. I think this is my strongest trait. I am always hopeful. That's why I keep trying. I have the biggest imagination and sometimes I see myself being happy and doing what I want.\n\nKids, have hope.

I was a sad kid throughout all of my life really, but it's not like I could not get out of bed or do things I wanted, but it was always a challenge to some extent. I always had social anxiety, at least I think I did because besides my few true friends, i could not talk to people at all.\n\n\nNow I am studying abroad at a nice university and could not be more proud even though it took me a lot of will power to get here. But the experience here was not what I expected. I am now a third year compsci student and for the past two years I couldn't make any friends. My social anxiety worsened the more time I spent alone. To the point where I always felt isolated and judged by everyone. \n\n\nWhile at first I was a really good student, due to my worsening anxiety my grades started to drop. I started missing lectures and really struggling with exams. Then I didn't get the internship I wanted and I know that there is a lot of competition in my field and I dont even have experience. Then I had to find a supervisor for my dissertation and I just couldnt think of anything I would be interested. I think that's when I sort of gave up. Came back home because I couldnt deal with it anymore and spent my whole summer just trying to exist as hard as I could. Went for many walks feeling depersonalized and really low.\n\n\nThe summer ended and I had to come back to my uni life. The problem is that I was still feeling the same way. And now I really have to do a lot. And Im afraid I just can't. I don't want to drop out. I had to choose whatever the supervisor was left after the summer, and I really struggled with coming up with a topic. In fact I still dont really know it. I just agreed on whatever my supervisor suggested because I couldnt come up with anything myself. And now I feel like I am in a territory where I have no knowledge. And its scary. My deadline for the project proposal is really soon and I havent slept and Im shivering from anxiety and I just dont feel like I can cope. \n\nThere is a counselling service at uni and I think its time to get an appointment.

I always knew that I am shy and not overly confident, but my friends kept me sane.\n\nBut now, oh now, I'm just so lost. It's almost the end of my first year at the university and I have made 0 friends. Of course I was naive at first, hoping I would do a lot of great things, join societies, find a lot of friends, volunteer, find a job etc etc. But I'm mostly afraid to leave my room. I tried joining societies. I joined a few of my interest. I guess I've got a few acquaintances, but I feel like I've pushed them away. I nominated myself for a Course Rep role and since nobody else did, I got in. I thought this would be a good way to find new friends, but through the year, I was too scared to interact with my course mates and only attended one meeting which to be honest felt like hell. I tried going out to my course social events. That sort of atmosphere was a bit nicer as it was not as official or academic. Some people approached me and told me they have noticed me, so I did manage to have a chit chat with a few of them, but after that nothing changed and they all formed their own groups, so I felt excluded. Then I was introduced with Hackathons, usually an event where a lot of people come from different universities and try to program something cool for 24 or more hours to win prizes. I thought that was cool and decided to try. First hackathon was in my university. I did manage to find a team through team building games and we built a simple game for a smart watch. That was probably the best thing that happened this year. Of course, even though my team consisted of a few course mates, I did not manage to keep a contact with them later on. Then I went to another hackathon in another city, did find a team, but then left early as it felt too hard to deal with all the anxiety. Today is another hackathon, but I left just after it started. I just couldn't. The whole point of it is to have fun, but it's pure torture for me. I saw a lot of beautiful and smart people there, but I just couldn't even find a team. I felt stupid, but I knew I had to leave, even if the venue was gorgeous and there were many cool things to do. I could have made a one man team, but I would have felt miserable.\n\nThe point is, it's not normal. I don't deserve this. I can't live this life of solitude and depression. I am trying as much as I can, but it feels like it only gets worse. It's affecting my life in a negative way and there must be something I could do. There must be?\n\nI don't know what makes me so afraid of people. I can't think of any logical reason behind this.

Maybe everything is actually not as bad as I think, but my problems are bigger in my mind than they actually are, and I have no control of my mind. I have social anxiety too.

Life is hard for everyone and one shouldn't be afraid of difficult things, because they make us stronger. I always say that to myself. But even though I do, I'm helpless when my brain decides to throw me an attack of hell, where I cannot even describe the things I think and things I feel.\n\nI'm just tired.

Sometimes it happens almost every time I wake it up, sometimes rarely at all. I just see a black screen and a cursor when it happens. It lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and then it wakes up, but that is becoming really annoying. I have done a SMC and PRAM reset, I have also reinstalled OS X Mavericks, but the issue is still present. Is there anything I could do to solve this?
