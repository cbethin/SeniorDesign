He\u2019s stayed at the hospital with me when I got sick because I wasn\u2019t taking care of my type I diabetes.

Shockingly, I am on speaking terms with them, but I truly believe that they are both sick in the head, and I think my father in particular is a true narcissist.\n\nOne of my first truly traumatic memories is of my father picking my sister up by the throat and slamming her against the wall because she was \u2018talking back\u2019. She was 11 years old. I also remember that he used to threaten to put a padlock on the fridge because I was \u2018too fat\u2019. He emotionally, financially and physically abused us, albeit I fared a lot better than my sister because she was less afraid to stand up for herself than I was.\n\nMy sister and I are both type I diabetics. When we were around 10 years old, my mother took us to an appointment to see the endocrinologist at the hospital, and she asked my father if she could have some money for lunch. He gave her $20 and told her that he expected her to bring change back. When my mother received a sizeable inheritance, despite the fact that their mortgage was almost paid off, he decided that we were going to move into a bigger, more luxurious house. My mother didn\u2019t want to, but one day he came home and told her we were moving\u2014he\u2019d put an offer on a $500,000 house without consulting her. That was just the kind of person he was. He was self-centred and egotistical, and he was insanely controlling when it came to money. He valued it above everything else. It probably didn\u2019t even occur to him that the inheritance wasn\u2019t his money to spend, because he felt utterly entitled to it.\n\nThose are surprisingly not the worst memories I have, not by far. I only found out this year but when I was 12 years old, shortly after we moved into our new house, my mother split up with my father. He was miserable. My mother told me that his boss would regularly call her and beg her to take him back because he was constantly crying at work. One day, she forced him to tell my sister and I that he\u2019d been growing and selling massive quantities of marijuana since before we were born. Shortly before he moved out, he\u2019d been excavating under the house so that he could build an enormous grow room. At this point, my parents had been married for 25 years, and I discovered that for over two decades, my mother had been slowly going insane with the anxiety she felt that one day, the police would raid our house and take everything away from us. He didn\u2019t care. He was too concerned about the money that he was making to give a shit about her feelings.\n\nI consider what happened next to be a defining moment in my life, the day I truly lost my innocence. I wasn\u2019t even a teenager yet. My sister and I were sitting on the couch and my mother was up the other end of the house. My father came home from work early, and he was crying. He kissed us both on the forehead, told us that he loved us and went to his bedroom. We followed him in because we were worried about him, and then we watched as he swallowed an entire bottle of pills. We saw him begin to foam at the mouth. I ran to tell my mother that he was dying, and then we watched as the paramedics carried him out of the house in his boxer shorts because he couldn\u2019t walk. It was the worst day of my life, and even now, 11 years later, I still can\u2019t talk about it without breaking down, despite years of psychotherapy. Neither my sister nor I like to tell people about it because it well and truly fucked us up, and it makes people uncomfortable. Some people get it more than others, but most people I know don\u2019t know how to deal with it because they have no basis for comparison. They grew up in homes with loving parents and happy memories. They weren\u2019t forced to grow up too soon, to have their personalities shaped by something horrific.\n\nThings got pretty shitty after that. My mother had been so starved for affection that she\u2019d been dating a man online while they were still married, and when I was 15, she decided that we were going to move interstate to be closer to him. That didn\u2019t pan out\u2014he kept coming up with excuses as to why he couldn\u2019t meet her. She was desperate to be loved, though, and she began to spend the money that she\u2019d gotten from the sale of the house on psychic hotlines, where she\u2019d ask a ton of different variations of the question, why doesn\u2019t he love me enough? All in all, she spent $250,000. She might have been there physically, but we never saw her. The only emotional interaction I ever had with her was when she backed me into a corner and screamed in my face because she thought my friend called her stupid, or when she snatched my phone and went through my messages because she suspected that I was texting my boyfriend (who I\u2019d been forced to leave behind) about how miserable I was. Other than that\u2026 she only cooked one meal in the nine months that I lived there, which was a dish that her online boyfriend had given her the recipe for. Other than that, we ate takeaway every single day. She didn\u2019t want to drive us to school, so she\u2019d put us in a taxi and send us on our way. We only got in her car a few times, and one day, she almost crashed it because she was distracted thinking about *him*.\n\nI ran away from home after a little while. My mother wouldn\u2019t let my sister come with me, even when my father\u2019s father died, she wouldn\u2019t let her attend the funeral as she was offended that she hadn\u2019t been invited. But eventually, she relented, and my sister and I moved back to our home state to live with our father.\n\nHe was never home. He\u2019d met a new girlfriend and he was more interested in spending time with her than raising us. We had parties every weekend because if you were 16 years old and basically lived alone, what would you do? My sister began using drugs. She slept around a lot and cut herself. When my father and his girlfriend (now wife) finally bought a house together (another $600,000 McMansion, because he had to have the perfect house and the perfect car and the perfect motorcycle and the perfect life), we moved in. To cut a long story short, because this post is already too long, she was an alcoholic narcissist who made him look like a saint. She was the human incarnation of the wicked stepmother. To exemplify this, she used to call my sister Cindy, as in Cinderella, because she forced her to do all the chores. When my sister got a full-time job and could no longer wait on her hand and foot, she decided that she was no longer of use to her and kicked her out of the house. My father didn\u2019t say anything, because he cared more about having the perfect marriage than he did about us. She was almost homeless, and eventually, she was raped, which caused her to spiral. She still won\u2019t tell me how many men she slept with, but I know it was over 40. She\u2019s doing well now\u2014she\u2019s the strongest person I know\u2014but for a while there, she was on a very dark path, and it has left irreparable scars on her psyche.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go into much more detail but it did get worse from there. Inevitably, I got kicked out too and ended up living with my father-in-law, who is an even bigger narcissist than my father was. But I\u2019m safe now. I live with my partner, the same one who I had to move away from. We\u2019ve been together for 8 years now, and he is my biggest cheerleader. He has been there for me through everything, and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be today without him.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t /r/raisedbynarcissists, this is a place where people come to talk about their lives post-narcissism. But I am here to talk about that, I promise. It\u2019s now been 5 years since I moved back down and I finally had the opportunity to recover the family photographs that my mother had kept with her, so my sister decided to arrange a viewing party at her house. I was excited at the time, but I now know that this was a huge mistake. I sat with her and we watched videos of us when we were eighteen months old, and our father was playing with us and being so affectionate, telling us he loved us and that we were his girls. We were so happy and innocent. We hadn\u2019t yet been destroyed by everything that was to come. I am crying writing this, and to be frank, I\u2019ve been crying for 3 days now. We sat and we looked at all the photographs of us as children and I bawled my eyes out because I knew I would never get to be that person again. I can\u2019t even think about my childhood because all I can think about is what I\u2019ve lost, what we\u2019ve both lost. It brought up so many horrible memories. Last night, I started thinking about when I saw my father close to death and I began to hyperventilate. It was the first panic attack I\u2019ve had in years. I had to take a Valium to calm down, and even then, I still felt it acutely.\n\nThings did get better for me, for us. But after seeing those pictures, I feel like a broken person, like all the progress I\u2019ve made has been for nought. I don\u2019t understand how he could love us and care for us so much, and then he let all this horrible shit happen to us because he didn\u2019t care enough to stop it. I feel like I\u2019ve been gut-shot. I know it will get better but it just hurts so much right now. I wish I had been born into one of those happy families, that I didn\u2019t have to be hard and tough and resilient because I\u2019d come to expect that somebody somewhere was going to screw me over or leave me. I wish I didn\u2019t feel like I want to die every time I think about that little girl who no longer exists. I\u2019m sorry that this was so bleak, but I had to get it out of my system. I am so sorry that you all had to go through the things that you did, and I wish it could\u2019ve been different for all of us.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LifeAfterNarcissism", "subreddit_id": "t5_30biu", "subreddit_subscribers": 10792, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Trigger Warning] Grieving for lost childhood", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/8ifr5u/trigger_warning_grieving_for_lost_childhood/"}]}
